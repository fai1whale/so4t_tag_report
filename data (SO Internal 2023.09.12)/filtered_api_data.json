Stack Overflow for Teams provides a platform for developers to ask questions and share knowledge, which can foster collaboration and streamline communication.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Knowledge Base</strong>: It allows the creation of a knowledge base for the team. This is vital in Agile, as teams often need to refer back to solutions and decisions made in earlier sprints. This helps in maintaining a continuous flow and understanding of the project.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Faster Problem-Solving</strong>: Agile teams work in sprints and need to address issues quickly. Stack Overflow for Teams helps in solving problems faster by providing a space where team members can ask questions and get answers from their peers, often much faster than searching the internet or waiting for a scheduled meeting.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Documentation</strong>: Agile teams often evolve code and features rapidly. Stack Overflow for Teams can be used to keep documentation up to date. Team members can post explanations, code samples, and other useful information which can serve as a living document.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Integration with Development Tools</strong>: Stack Overflow for Teams can be integrated with popular development tools such as Jira, GitHub, and Slack. This ensures that information flows seamlessly among the tools used in the Agile process, making it easier to track issues, share code, and communicate.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Reduced Dependency on Specific Team Members</strong>: In Agile teams, it is important to reduce the dependency on specific team members for knowledge. Stack Overflow for Teams allows knowledge to be shared and accessible to all members, which can reduce the 'key person dependency' problem.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Continuous Learning and Improvement</strong>: Agile is about continuous improvement. Stack Overflow for Teams facilitates this by providing a platform where team members can learn from each other, share best practices, and collectively improve their skills and knowledge.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Archiving Decision Rationale</strong>: During Agile development, numerous decisions are made rapidly. Stack Overflow for Teams can serve as a repository for archiving the rationale behind decisions, which can be very helpful for both current team members and those who join the project at a later stage.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Enhancing Code Quality</strong>: By sharing code snippets and getting peer reviews through Stack Overflow for Teams, developers can ensure that code quality is maintained, which is critical for Agile delivery.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Feedback Loop</strong>: Agile relies on feedback loops. Stack Overflow for Teams can serve as a platform for giving and receiving feedback, which is crucial for the iterative nature of Agile development.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>By leveraging Stack Overflow for Teams effectively, Agile teams can improve collaboration, knowledge sharing, problem-solving, and ultimately deliver high-quality software products in a timely manner.</p>\n"}], "owner": {"account_id": 26591814, "reputation": 1271, "user_id": 909, "user_type": "registered", "profile_image": "https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/images/s/cde42a25-e8a3-4d5e-b160-2c2a5bec51a7.png?s=256&g=1", "display_name": "Munaf Dalvi", "link": "https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/users/909/munaf-dalvi"}, "comment_count": 0, "is_answered": true, "view_count": 13, "down_vote_count": 0, "up_vote_count": 0, "answer_count": 1, "score": 0, "creation_date": 1687337351, "question_id": 23594, "link": "https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/questions/23594/how-can-stack-overflow-for-teams-be-leveraged-within-agile-methodology", "title": "How can Stack Overflow for Teams be leveraged within Agile methodology?", "body": "<p>We've been asked to present on this topic to an Agile working group at an existing customer.

If you're an SE and you happen to understand the API as well as what the customer is trying to achieve, I see no harm with pointing the customer towards the correct API endpoints or educating them on things like filters or creating API keys -- these are also the sorts of things our support organization would help with. Similarly, however, we should probably draw a line when it comes to supporting a customer's creations (vs. supporting the API itself).</p>\n<p>In contrast, if you're an SE that doesn't really understand the API, I don't see any harm in sending the customer a link to the documentation or encouraging them to open a support ticket for additional API questions. Another option -- especially when the customer is looking for some thoughtful/consultative guidance -- would be to leverage another SE who is fluent with the API to provide the customer some guidance.

Though at least, there is one scenario where you'll be able to tell if that customer doesn't have Slack setup, and that's if they still haven't setup SSO - and as noted above you can check that. \u266a</p>\n"}, {"owner": {"account_id": 25792188, "reputation": 449, "user_id": 834, "user_type": "registered", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "display_name": "Greg Sheedy", "link": "https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/users/834/greg-sheedy"}, "comment_count": 0, "down_vote_count": 0, "up_vote_count": 2, "is_accepted": false, "score": 2, "last_activity_date": 1686585216, "creation_date": 1686585216, "answer_id": 23509, "question_id": 23498, "link": "https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/questions/23498/how-can-i-confirm-a-client-set-up-sso-slack-integration/23509#23509", "body": "<p>You can check Integration Y/N through the following reports</p>\n<p>For business Customers you can check the dashboard view for review :</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/admin/support/teams\">SO Dashboard</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/images/s/35f7c269-21bf-4333-8adb-46e5ce123675.png\"><img src=\"https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/images/s/35f7c269-21bf-4333-8adb-46e5ce123675.png\" alt=\"SSO Image\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/images/s/dc345727-ab3f-425b-a038-7d8c8765799b.png\"><img src=\"https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/images/s/dc345727-ab3f-425b-a038-7d8c8765799b.png\" alt=\"Integration View\"></a></p>\n<p>Enterprise</p>\n<p>You can check this report for Integration Usage for Enterprise Customers by filtering on your specific Customer</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://looker.ds.stackexchange.com/looks/2614\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Look Daily Report</a></p>\n"}], "owner": {"account_id": 27794586, "reputation": 75, "user_id": 985, "user_type": "registered", "profile_image": "https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/images/s/f7672174-4ad9-485b-aed3-950d066a6a10.png?s=256&g=1", "display_name": "Pedro Cruz", "link": "https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/users/985/pedro-cruz"}, "comment_count": 0, "is_answered": true, "view_count": 48, "down_vote_count": 0, "up_vote_count": 2, "accepted_answer_id": 23499, "answer_count": 2, "score": 2, "creation_date": 1686576349, "question_id": 23498, "link": "https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/questions/23498/how-can-i-confirm-a-client-set-up-sso-slack-integration", "title": "How can I confirm a client set up SSO &amp; Slack Integration?", "body": "<p>Outside of just asking the client, is there a way for me to determine if SSO and Slack Integration have been set up on a new site?</p>\n<p>I checked Freshdesk and didn't see a ticket created by the client to schedule time to meet with Support Team.

However, due to credential issues, reports stopped functioning. R Studio is also going to be decommissioned by Stack in the near future, as it has minimal users and a significant annual cost.</p>\n<p>To maintain reporting functionality, the Data Platform team ran analytics manually for a while for the Site Satisfaction Survey, then set up a custom API pull using Databricks.

This is used during deployments to mark an app as unhealthy to make sure that App Gateway doesn\u2019t send traffic to it and we can safely deploy a new app.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/StackEng/StackOverflow/blob/ef3a1b3cad6ba39e3bc8fbb0a0d3c3cb431a9b87/StackOverflow.ChannelsDbApi/HealthChecks/HealthCircuitBreakerMiddleware.cs#L8-L35\" data-onebox-id=\"146\" class=\"onebox-link\">https://github.com/StackEng/StackOverflow/blob/ef3a1b3cad6ba39e3bc8fbb0a0d3c3cb431a9b87/StackOverflow.ChannelsDbApi/HealthChecks/HealthCircuitBreakerMiddleware.cs#L8-L35</a></p>\n<p>All health endpoints and the circuit breaker are limited to internal clients only. This to avoid exposing sensitive information externally or having clients call the circuit breaker to bring our app down.</p>\n<p>See the Microsoft documentation for more information on how health checks work: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/health-checks\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/health-checks</a></p>\n<h2>Deployment pipeline</h2>\n<p>All our pipelines follow the general pattern that you can see in the following screenshot:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/images/s/7c030f71-70b1-44cb-a4d2-b42029ff6a24.png\"><img src=\"https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/images/s/7c030f71-70b1-44cb-a4d2-b42029ff6a24.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n<p>First, we mark an app as unhealthy in App Gateway to make sure App Gateway stops sending traffic to the app. This is done by an Octopus worker calling the deployment circuit breaker that each app has. We then wait until App Gateway reports the app as unhealthy before continuing with the deployment.</p>\n<p>Once the deployment is finished, we wait for the newly deployed app to become healthy. We do this by monitoring App Gateway for that specific app instance.

The more info button will allow you to see the Latency of your internet connection.</p>\n<p>There are other websites that do similar tests, but I find fast.com the most reliable and consistent. As always a quick google search for \u2018internet connection test\u2019 will probably bring you to some of the more popular ones.</p>\n<h3>Home Internet</h3>\n<p>General guidelines to look for when selecting internet provider and service.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>As a general rule as a minimum you should strive for 10 mbps download and 10 mbps upload per device.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>For a family of 2-4 people we recommend a minimum internet connection of 100 download / 100 upload.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The Latency of your internet connection will vary depending on the type of service you have available to you. Fiber has the lowest latency and it can sit as low as 5ms. Cable can go as low as 10-20 ms. DSL can be in the 20-40 ms range. Satellite connections are hard to predict but they can be 150+ ms.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please keep in mind that your internet service numbers will vary depending on your location and time of day. Also internet service connection to your home does not equal internet service to your devices. That\u2019s why it's important to have quality Home WiFi equipment that has good coverage for your homes.

I will sometimes even refer to a POV as Proof-of-Adoption on a side note to the customer, to reinforce where the focus for a POV lies.</p>\n<h2><strong>1) POV / Initial Community building (2-3 months)</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><p>During this phase, the focus is on <strong>building</strong> a healthy knowledge-sharing community from the ground up (vs. realizing value from an already functioning community).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Building a successful community takes time and effort, and from our experience instantiating thousands (15,000) of private communities, we learned what is required to do this successfully. This includes <strong>time commitment</strong> from a number of key stakeholders.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Building this community will ultimately result in <strong>making tribal knowledge</strong> <strong>reusable</strong>, which will generate a lot of value <strong>in the mid- and long-term</strong>.

It's hard to quantify the exact numbers of SMEs within the community. To improve this model, we could try to extract the unique number of answerers etc..... But the purpose of this exercise was just to give us a quick indication of the <strong>potential value</strong> of Stack Overflow for these two personas.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Particularly for SMEs, the potential can be huge. They are one of the critical roles for a successful launch, so hopefully this helps to more easily explain the &quot;what's in it for me&quot; to them.

And if I want to be honest, I don't think it's a good idea to pursue it, and would instead recommend that Team / Enterprise moderators make good use of the &quot;Pending Approval&quot; list of synonyms that you linked.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The public voting system for tag synonyms was something designed within the constraints of the public Q&amp;A. This is a significantly larger userbase than every client we have and will ever have, and is easily identified by the threshold for voting: users must have a score of at least 5 across answers to the tag and you need at least 4 such users to perform this. This worked in the public Q&amp;A because it was established years after we already had enough people, so getting &quot;4 people who participate in this tag&quot; is drive by and easy enough for users dedicated to non-appointed moderation activity.</p>\n<p>In early points in the adoption lifecycle, this is a potentially irksome barrier, due to a myriad of factors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Getting people to vote a lot in the start</li>\n<li>Getting enough questions for <em>different</em> people to provide answers</li>\n<li>Getting enough people that you don't need to hound basically the same 4 people from each separate team to handle synonyms in their domain</li>\n<li>Getting those people to have enough motivation to handle non-appointed moderation activity across the board when it is apparently already a chore for a dedicated moderator to look into the information</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While I understand the point brought up about &quot;There's a lot of pages to consider already for moderators, who already have day jobs&quot;, I still advise the Pending Approval page for the simple reason that <strong>this is the page that action can actually be taken to get it done with</strong>. This is a page that contains all of both the necessary information to evaluate decisions on the process, and all of the necessary tools to take action on those decisions.</p>\n<p>Creating an API printout of tag synonym suggestions that can be accessed in reports or in an external system may surface the issues faster, but still mean they have to visit the site to get a full picture of the situation. Or, it means extra development time on the customer's end to create the reporting on a thorough enough scale to... replicate a system we already have built.</p>\n<p>I would also motion that synonyms are not a system that needs heavy or frequent monitoring. When a new technology or prospect results in a new tag series, maybe it may warrant some extra attention as people find footing, but otherwise parlance and vocabulary tend to settle quickly enough that synonyms could be checked on like, a monthly basis.</p>\n<p>Thinking on it - <strong>if the issue is there's a lot of disparate pages that need to be reviewed by moderators, then maybe we need to fix the moderator dashboard to address this</strong>. On the public Q&amp;A, the moderator dashboard is focused on flag handling because that represents the majority of their job since the community size is large enough to handle the smaller components, along with vote fraud investigation. The other pages like the tag synonym summary lists or duplicate post analysis are just collected on another page as links to individually check. This doesn't line up with the major responsibilities of moderators on intra-organizational Q&amp;A, where seeing things like an overview of &quot;Recently created tags in the last weeks&quot;, or &quot;Tag synonym suggestions&quot;, or similar might help from a numeric indicator that tells you &quot;There's something to actually look at here&quot;. Basically - consider options to make it so that there is a place on-site where moderators can identify that there is something they need to do from a glance, before needing to visit the individual pages to do such things.</p>\n"}], "owner": {"account_id": 16663508, "reputation": 13637, "user_id": 365, "user_type": "moderator", "profile_image": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-3D9FGQwb-8Q/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcP7uq9BSdpBavmHjRAhXPHV4d66Q/photo.jpg?sz=256", "display_name": "Jonathan Klick", "link": "https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/users/365/jonathan-klick"}, "comment_count": 0, "is_answered": true, "view_count": 30, "down_vote_count": 0, "up_vote_count": 4, "answer_count": 1, "score": 4, "creation_date": 1685445735, "question_id": 23349, "link": "https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/questions/23349/is-there-an-api-for-surfacing-tag-synonym-suggestions", "title": "Is there an API for surfacing tag synonym suggestions?", "body": "<p>Is there an API for grabbing the currently suggested tag synonyms (i.e. the ones that have NOT <a href=\"https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/a/23329/365\">completed a voting cycle</a> yet)?</p>\n<p>I've looked at the API objects for <a href=\"https://api.stackoverflowteams.com/docs/types/tag\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">tags</a> and <a href=\"https://api.stackoverflowteams.com/docs/types/tag-synonym\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">tag synonyms</a>, but neither seems to include tag synonym <em><strong>suggestions</strong></em> -- only the synonyms that have been formally configured/accepted.

Developers don\u2019t like to write documentation and having more time means they\u2019ll spend it on more complex tasks, not documenting their work.\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If answer is no: That\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard from other clients too. They're still struggling with the gap between brain-stored and documentation-stored knowledge too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What I\u2019m hearing them say is that they are looking at Stack Overflow for Teams as that last mile connection between knowledge stored and knowledge delivered or between general and domain specific knowledge. Because it\u2019s easy and natural for a developer to ask or answer a question for a colleague rather than write documentation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>How are you thinking about solving for that gap? Do you think Copilot can do that for you?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><code>If the answer is yes:</code></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>That\u2019s awesome\u2014and unusual! Where do you think they\u2019ll be doing that documentation? Is that documentation accessible to other teams such as QA, Ops, Security, and product management/marketing? How has discovery been there, historically?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>**<br>\nThen, you ask:**</p>\n<p>I have one other question about Copilot for you and then we can move on. With your developers being free to work on more complex challenges, how are you thinking about distributing those new learnings to the rest of the org?\u00a0</p>\n<p>I ask because I\u2019m hearing that Copilot is great at enabling individual developers but it doesn\u2019t really do anything to capture or distribute the new approaches that those developers come up with. It\u2019s almost like we\u2019re keeping developers in their silos with Copilot and not connecting them to the network of peers internally.</p>\n<p>How are you thinking about reusing the knowledge from these developers and making sure folks aren\u2019t recreating the wheel? Do you think Copilot can do that for you?\u00a0</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Resources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/articles/20336\">GitHub Copilot Battlecard</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/articles/23146\">See how Copilot works</a> (webinar on Copilot that shows how it helps developers)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lruKGOZORZJ3fV5fnrd-QJK3ikVgeOqd2n9tEcRfwjM/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Customer-facing slides</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.zoom.us/rec/share/3idswwsrcVnUEgA84hnUpTnML3eAYahHAvNZCMhPJSSBbvNCHZ-zMFuOHXoeC7iU.CE9zgartumoXu7pq\" rel=\"noreferrer\">AI-assisted tools Educast</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/questions/23308\">More basic answers and guidance</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>Other questions you can use to understand their thought process around AI:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>What are some of the challenges your companies are trying to overcome?

Could make one but at least for now there isn't such.</p>\n<p>There is an automation system where we do purge unused tags, which is <a href=\"https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/questions/18639\">best covered in this question</a>. Other than that, the tags page is the system designed for reviewing tags. It can be sorted by Newest if you're looking into newly created tags, or it can be sorted by Popular and then sifted to the end to review tags that are not really being used. At a glance, you'll be able to see the number of posts that are using the tag, and whether or not a subject matter expert has been assigned (as there will be no &quot;Manage subject matter experts&quot; link without them).</p>\n<p>That said, from a community management perspective... I would recommend suggesting that this isn't a major concern, for two reasons.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tagging is an organic process that develops as the system is used long term. The tag culling process takes 6 months because it's an ample time to ensure that, really, no one is actually using the tag. Tags that random users create on a whim tend to fall for this because they only created it on the spot, and if no one else bothers to use it then it'll get purged softly.</li>\n<li>You can drastically reduce the overhead of needing to review tags if you teach your userbase to tag with the intent of getting answers. I say this a lot, but the genuine purpose of tags isn't &quot;to categorize content&quot;, it's &quot;<strong>to get your question answered</strong>&quot;. That's why it's required before you can even post the question. You can read a deeper level treatise from me on the subject <a href=\"https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/questions/21580/21592#21592\">here</a> but in summation, remind users that it's in their best interest to use tags that already exist because <strong>no one can subscribe to a tag before it exists</strong>, thus drastically weakening its ability to get answered. Creating a new tag makes sense if you're the first person asking about a brand new project or company direction, but if you're not, the first stop should be to figure out what existing tag helps surface the question to the people who will actually give you an answer. Encourage users to approach their questions this way and it should reduce new tag creation woes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This isn't ultimately going to solve poor tags ever being generated, but it should reduce it to a degree that an API generated dig up of tag usage every few months will suffice to help clean up underused or unusued tags. Or just using the Tags page sorted by popularity, if one wants to view it directly in-site.</p>\n"}, {"owner": {"account_id": 25159150, "reputation": 4427, "user_id": 759, "user_type": "registered", "profile_image": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhOjGQcydkhtX-0XQUWcDP7aR1MZq4h1RLfbNCu=k-s256", "display_name": "Tiago Torre", "link": "https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/users/759/tiago-torre"}, "comment_count": 0, "down_vote_count": 0, "up_vote_count": 2, "is_accepted": false, "score": 2, "last_activity_date": 1684907353, "last_edit_date": 1684907353, "creation_date": 1684872374, "answer_id": 23294, "question_id": 23291, "link": "https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/questions/23291/do-tags-without-much-content-or-an-sme-linked-get-proactively-pushed-to-be-rev/23294#23294", "body": "<p>RE tags with no SMEs assigned:</p>\n<p>For big communities, it can make sense to restrict tag creation, at least during launch or a POV.

So that's why we sign the PowerShell scripts.</p>\n<p>With the sunsetting on SOE On-Prem, this becomes a lesser issue, however, we are still committed until Mid-2025 and thus need a solution in place.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-which-signtool.exe-is-being-used\">Which signtool.exe is being used?</h2>\n<p>There are many different versions of signtool.exe, some ship with Visual Studio, .NET SDKs, or the Windows SDK.

And we will configure the Teams environment we're testing to use this new MS Teams app. If you're testing in prod you would skip this step because prod has an MS Teams app that's published to the marketplace and it's configured to be used on stackoverflowteams.com already. To create a new MS Teams app for testing follow these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Go to: <a href=\"https://teams.microsoft.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://teams.microsoft.com/</a> and login with your admin user that you created as part of your E5 subscriptions. In my case it's <code>admin@0tz2r.onmicrosoft.com</code></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Logins can be funky sometimes so if you get an access error, try again later.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><p>Go to <strong>Developer Portal</strong> -&gt; <strong>Tools</strong> -&gt; <strong>Bot management</strong> . We need to setup a new chat bot for our new MS Teams app</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/images/s/80ed74a4-7daa-4e8d-88be-151cb7526021.png\"><img src=\"https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/images/s/80ed74a4-7daa-4e8d-88be-151cb7526021.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Click the <strong>New Bot</strong> button and give your bot a name to create a new bot and fill in the following details:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Endpoint address:</strong> <em>Tells the bot where to send chat messages</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>If the environment you're testing on has a reverse proxy for integrations you need to put that as your domain. In my case I'm testing on Dev so I put the following: <code>https://integrations.stackoverflowteams.dev/integrations/microsoft-teams/messages</code></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If you don't have a reverse proxy or want to bypass it you can directly point the bot to your environment instead. E.g: <code>https://stackoverflowteams.dev/integrations/microsoft-teams/messages</code></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If you're testing a local environment, you need some way for MS Teams to be able to send http requests to your machine. We have an amazing guide on how to do that using ngrok here: <a href=\"https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/a/6674/554\">https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/a/6674/554</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Channels</strong>: check the <strong>Microsoft Teams</strong> box</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Client secrets:</strong> Generate a new secret here and copy it somewhere safe</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><p>Configure the Teams environment you're testing to use this new bot by updating these site settings:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><code>MicrosoftTeams.BotAppId</code> You can find this on the bot management page</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/images/s/5248a49a-e701-4d29-ba8f-d1ae10e45606.png\"><img src=\"https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/images/s/5248a49a-e701-4d29-ba8f-d1ae10e45606.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><code>MicrosoftTeams.BotAppPassword</code> Set this to the secret you generated earlier</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><p>Now we need to create a copy of our MS Teams app in your test MS Teams instance. For this go to <code>/integrations/microsoft-teams/manifest</code> on your environment which will download a <strong>zip</strong> file containing the MS Teams app.</p>\n<p>I'm testing on dev for this article so my link is: <code>https://stackoverflowteams.dev/integrations/microsoft-teams/manifest</code></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Now's a good time to open the zip file and check out the <strong>manifest.json</strong>. Make sure the <code>configurableTabs</code> and <code>staticTabs</code> point to the correct domain: reverse proxy if you have it, the environment domain if not, or your local ngrok if you're testing locally.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>To upload the app go to **Apps (**in the side bar) -&gt; <strong>Manage your apps</strong> -&gt; <strong>Upload an app</strong> -&gt; <strong>Upload a custom app</strong> and give it your zip file</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/images/s/0e302637-ded6-4779-aa60-2ea33bb553c8.png\"><img src=\"https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/images/s/0e302637-ded6-4779-aa60-2ea33bb553c8.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Click <strong>Add</strong> to install the custom app</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/images/s/3fe6bb9f-0191-421b-9535-f9b2cbef8bb1.png\"><img src=\"https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/images/s/3fe6bb9f-0191-421b-9535-f9b2cbef8bb1.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Done!

Personally Identifiable Information or PII, protected data, etc.) can vary from region to region depending on which data protection law or regulation applies.  Generally speaking, personal data means any personal information relating to, directly or indirectly, an identified or identifiable natural person, or household. This concept is crucial in the context of data protection and privacy regulations across the globe, as it helps define the scope of data subject rights (DSR).</p>\n<p>Data subject rights are the rights of individuals to control their personal information, as recognized by various data protection laws such as the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) in the European Union, the CCPA/CPRA (California Consumer Privacy Act/California Privacy Rights Act) in the United States, and many others.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-examples\">Examples</h3>\n<p><strong>Directly identifying personal data</strong> refers to information that can be used to identify an individual without the need for additional data. Examples include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Full name</li>\n<li>Social Security number</li>\n<li>Passport number</li>\n<li>Driver's license number</li>\n<li>Email address</li>\n<li>Phone number</li>\n<li>Mailing address</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Indirectly identifying personal data</strong> refers to information that, on its own, may not be sufficient to identify an individual but can be combined with other data to do so. Examples include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Date of birth</li>\n<li>Gender</li>\n<li>Job title</li>\n<li>Geolocation data</li>\n<li>IP address</li>\n<li>Browser cookies</li>\n<li>Device identifiers</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"heading-how-can-we-make-decisions-about-adding-personal-data-into-our-systems\">How can we make decisions about adding Personal Data into our Systems?</h2>\n<p>The first thing we should always try to do is employ privacy by design principles, such as data minimization - i.e., find a way <strong>not</strong> to add more personal data into our system or replicate existing personal data in additional data storage locations/tools unless it is absolutely necessary.</p>\n<p>Please ask yourself:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Do we really need this piece of personal data?</li>\n<li>Can the personal data <strong>not</strong> already be found somewhere else in the schema?</li>\n<li>Do you have a sufficient legal basis for processing this personal data?  In other words, can you make a legal justification to have this data, such as do we have valid consent or a contractual/legal obligation or a legitimate interest? (when in doubt, reach out to the legal privacy team)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you've said yes to all of the above, then it is imperative that developers read the technical information in this article to make sure the <code>dsr-cli</code> can handle this new addition.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-how-do-we-handle-dsr-requests\">How do we handle DSR requests?</h2>\n<p>The current tooling is utilized by the Legal Privacy Team to execute data subject rights requests (e.g., access or erasure requests) in a manner that allows for auditability to ensure compliance with various global data and privacy protection regulations and laws. To do this, we have developed a CLI (Command Line Interface) that requires some manual interaction.  This will allow the Legal Privacy Team to have more visibility into the personal data or PII of our users that we process.  This additionally provides the Legal Privacy Team to perform and redactions and apply legal exceptions (which the previous implementation did not allow), as well as allow for more auditability of the data before and after an erasure is processed, for example.</p>\n<h1 id=\"heading-engineering-focused-details\">Engineering Focused Details</h1>\n<h2 id=\"heading-dsr-cli\"><code>dsr-cli</code></h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/StackEng/dsr-cli\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">dsr-cli</a> is the tool created by <a href=\"https://stackexchange.slack.com/archives/C02R78VDFGW\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">#team-core-engineering</a> to achieve the outcomes desired for this process. This CLI tool runs on an internal data-center computer (ny-chrdp01) where only legal can access.</p>\n<p>At the high level, the cli executes against a few API endpoints for integrated third party systems as well as directly against our public platform databases.  The Database implementation for finding data was implemented by our DBRE team including Aaron Bertrand and Terry Long.  The third party integrations were implemented by Core-Engineering: Jacob Adams and Daniel McKinnon with consultation across the system owners.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-systems-currently-in-scope\">Systems Currently in Scope</h2>\n<p>Systems where the tool currently executes against as a direct database action:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>All Public Platform Sites</li>\n<li>PRIZM Database</li>\n<li>Providence</li>\n<li>Area51</li>\n<li>StackExchange</li>\n<li>StackMail</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Systems where the tool currently executes against an API endpoint:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Marketo</li>\n<li>OpenIDProvider</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"heading-how-can-dsr-cli-handle-new-personal-data-our-teams-needs-to-add\">How can <code>dsr-cli</code> handle new personal data our teams needs to add?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"heading-db-stored-procedure-update\">DB Stored Procedure Update</h3>\n<p>Some systems are already being mitigated through stored procedures that DBRE have implement across our systems.  If adding personal data into one of those current scopes (mentioned above) it could be possible to modify the stored procedure to work with the new additions.</p>\n<p>However, if this data is brand new, and part of new tables, it is beneficial to chose the API Endpoint option as this allows the team owning the schema/code to control how exports/erasures happen.  At some point in the future, the golden path would include endpoints for all PII sources and disconnect the stored procedures. This is currently unplanned work.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-api-endpoint-early-stages\">API Endpoint (early stages)</h3>\n<p><em>We are currently iterating on this process and welcome suggestions and comments to #team-core-engineering so we can make this process more seamless.</em></p>\n<p>We are asking teams that handle a certain domain of the business to handle the personal data <code>export</code> and <code>erasure</code> process themselves through an implemented API Endpoint.  While we do not want to give guidance on what these API Endpoints should be named, there is guidance as to what they should return.</p>\n<p>Two major compliance actions occur:</p>\n<p><code>export</code> - The endpoint that handles data access requests. This should accept an email as a post-parameter and return data in format shown in the <code>dsr-cli</code>'s README of its repository.</p>\n<p><code>erase</code> - The endpoint that handles data erasure requests.  This should accept an email as a post-parameter and return <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> signaling proper deletion or not.</p>\n<p>Once you have these endpoints, please notify <a href=\"https://stackexchange.slack.com/archives/C02R78VDFGW\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">#team-core-engineering</a> as soon as you can and we will add the domain's endpoints as another source of PII data to execute against.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-future-work-or-what-does-a-perfect-world-look-like\">Future Work (or What does a perfect world look like?)</h2>\n<p>We've not planned any current work to be done on this system.  But a future does exist in combination with our Self Service initiative where we can formalize the process of where we can execute requests within all of our systems.  We are also looking to integrate more with OneTrust in hopes that we can provide legal the same inspection of data and auditing they need while removing the manual nature of the CLI.</p>\n"}, {"tags": ["developer-survey"], "owner": {"account_id": 14873441, "reputation": 8065, "user_id": 239, "user_type": "team_admin", "display_name": "Joy Liuzzo", "link": "https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/users/239/joy-liuzzo"}, "comment_count": 0, "view_count": 15, "score": 2, "last_activity_date": 1686661755, "creation_date": 1686661755, "article_id": 23531, "article_type": "announcement", "link": "https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/articles/23531", "title": "2023 Developer Survey results", "body": "<h2 id=\"heading-release-date-june-13-2023\"><strong>Release date - June 13, 2023</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Results site</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/06/13/developer-survey-results-are-in/\">Results Blog post</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/06/13/hype-or-not-developers-have-something-to-say-about-ai/\">AI Blog post</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/_TMc5agRF0o\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Video recap</a> of the highlights</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.co/labs/developer-sentiment-ai-ml/\">AI deep dive analysis</a> on Stack Overflow Labs</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.co/company/press/archive/developer-survey-2023\">Press release</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-sales-assets\"><strong>Sales assets</strong></h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve written copy for you to send to clients and prospects</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MmulkdLes4p1HDN7RMwuCh5UrOBfAI6ARUx1TdHbDtY/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Advertising</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fmsoz_YxlRCbGqW6BkxdZET1pDPfiZN_J-arcYSkZ_w/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Employer Branding</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cRgAtMCcGZRCmbHCTxZn3PgsHHlWuJdGp8RNHtDAso4/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Stack Overflow for Teams</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also have <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Wy8lqi4oW-RvOkBxIxbG5HCwZm5XX8amJsS6MN9y_3w/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">some slides of the highlights</a> for you to use in your presentations.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We aren\u2019t doing standalone presentations this year.

Moving Teams to Azure allows us to meet certain infrastructure and compliance requirements for SOC 2 that would have been more difficult to achieve in our own datacenters.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-encryption-in-transit-and-at-rest\">Encryption in Transit and at Rest</h3>\n<p><strong>Encryption in transit</strong> is a way to protect data as it\u2019s transmitted across networks.\u00a0 Stack Overflow requires the use of HTTPS for clients to communicate with the site to ensure encryption in transit for Teams customers. But for many organizations, encryption in transit is not enough to meet data privacy and compliance standards. Those customers are looking for the additional assurance of <strong>encryption at rest</strong>. Until now, encryption at rest has been available only to Enterprise customers.</p>\n<p>Moving to Azure allows us to encrypt data at rest for the Business tier as well as Enterprise. We use SQL <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/transparent-data-encryption?view=sql-server-2017\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Transparent Date Encryption (TDE)</a> to encrypt data at rest. Data in transit is encrypted using TLS 1.2 using a SHA256 certificate with a 2048-bit key.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-scalability-and-flexibility\">Scalability and Flexibility</h2>\n<p>Azure's cloud infrastructure allows us to scale our resources quickly and efficiently. As our business grows, we can quickly adapt to increased traffic demands, ensuring a smooth user experience without compromising performance. This flexibility gives us the agility to meet our customers' evolving needs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-business-continuity\">Business Continuity</h2>\n<p>We have significantly bolstered our disaster recovery capabilities by setting up Teams as a read-only secondary backup on Azure. In the event of any unexpected disruptions or system failures, we can seamlessly switch to the secondary backup and minimize downtime, thus ensuring uninterrupted service to our users. Additionally, Azure\u2019s service-level agreement ensures 99.5% availability.\u00a0 Please note that this is not a \u201cdisaster recovery (DR)\u201d service, and is not equivalent to the SOE \u201cMulti-region HA Upgrade\u201d SKU.</p>\n<p>Upon completion of Blueshift, the standard deployment of Teams will be a hosted SaaS, multi-tenant instance in Microsoft Azure. Stack Overflow manages the infrastratucture and platform that hosts the application.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-high-availability\">High Availability</h3>\n<p>The Stack Overflow for Teams Business deployment is High Availability (HA) within a single region, meaning we offer two web servers located in a single region. HA ensures the application is functional even when part of the application is faulted. This includes the following scenarios:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Planned maintenance (server upgrades, patching, etc)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Unexpected errors (a server crashes)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Datacenter goes offline due to an extended outage</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While there is no secondary instance running with HA, we are still replicating the customer\u2019s data to a secondary region. If there is an outage in the Azure region, we would be able to rebuild a customer\u2019s instance with a \u201cbest effort\u201d recovery time objective. Note that SOE customers have the option to purchase an \u201cMulti-region HA Upgrade.\u201d</p>\n<p>Teams Business instances will be hosted in the Azure- East Region (West Region for failover). Business customers do not have the option to choose their region.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-cost-optimization\">Cost Optimization</h2>\n<p>Azure's pay-as-you-go model enables us to optimize our costs by only paying for the resources we use. This scalability, combined with efficient resource allocation and management, allows us to control our expenses and allocate our budget more effectively, ultimately driving our bottom line. This supports our company\u2019s FY2024 strategic priority of <em>Efficient &amp; Predictable Revenue Growth</em>.</p>\n"}, {"tags": ["so-for-teams", "customer-success", "customer-enablement"], "comments": [{"owner": {"account_id": 42929, "reputation": 4950, "user_id": 626, "user_type": "team_admin", "display_name": "Derrek Young", "link": "https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/users/626/derrek-young"}, "score": 1, "creation_date": 1686228050, "post_id": 23461, "comment_id": 16721, "link": "https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/questions/23461/customer-enablement-resource-library#comment16721_23461", "body": "Customer Enablement Recordings and bite-size demos: <a href=\"https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/articles/17349\">stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/articles/17349</a>"}, {"owner": {"account_id": 23836804, "reputation": 3004, "user_id": 687, "user_type": "registered", "display_name": "Miki Hunt", "link": "https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/users/687/miki-hunt"}, "score": 0, "creation_date": 1686228430, "post_id": 23461, "comment_id": 16723, "link": "https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/questions/23461/customer-enablement-resource-library#comment16723_23461", "body": "@DerrekYoung Thanks, Derrek!

This decision was based on our experience with App Services and existing tooling we have in place.</p>\n<p>Currently, we are able to get some basic telemetry data and logs thanks to the integration with Azure and Datadog. However, we cannot get full APM experience as our other App Services based applications have because of lacking support for containerised App Services APM.</p>\n<p>We have evaluated the options to enable APM and decided to leave it as is since we have enough observability with the logs and a basic availability <a href=\"https://us3.datadoghq.com/dashboard/5pn-245-jny?from_ts=1685972164182&amp;to_ts=1685975764182&amp;live=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">dashboard</a> and Traducir has extremely low load (180 requests per hour).</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-option-1-app-services-multi-container-deployment\">Option 1: App Services Multi-container Deployment</h2>\n<p>Multi-container deployment is currently in preview and none of our CD tools (GHA and Octopus Deploy) support it. The only option to do the deployment is using <code>az</code> cli with a <code>docker-compose</code> file: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/tutorial-multi-container-app\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/tutorial-multi-container-app</a>. If we had to do it, we could've done it for GHA. This also arises a question about deployments: &quot;Do we want GHA to be our only CI/CD tool?&quot;. We don't think it is the right time to answer this question even GHA provides great deal of workflow management such as <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/reviewing-deployments\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">deployment review process</a>.</p>\n<p>Additionally, it does not end just with the deployment. The example in <a href=\"https://docs.datadoghq.com/containers/docker/apm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tracing Docker Applications</a> needs to be converted to <code>docker-compose</code> and tested to ensure it works. We weren't sure whether we should invest our time and we don't think containerised App Services is the path we'd like to pave.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-option-2-install-datadog-agent-to-container-image\">Option 2: Install Datadog Agent to container image</h2>\n<p>We don't think we should ever promote installing a third-party agent to any of our application's container image. There are a few reasons why we don't want to do it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lost isolation</li>\n<li>Increased attack surface</li>\n<li>Dependabot fatigue</li>\n<li>Larger image size</li>\n<li>Possible inability to run locally</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"heading-option-3-switch-to-container-apps\">Option 3: Switch to Container Apps</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do not confuse Container Apps with Container Instances. Here's the comparison: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/compare-options\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/compare-options</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This one is closer to the road we'd like to pave but GHA is the only CD tool can be used. It runs workloads on AKS without providing direct access to Kubernetes APIs. It is an offering somewhere between Container Instances and AKS.</p>\n<p>The major advantage of using Container Apps is the ability to provide Kubernetes Pod resource-like YAML configuration and possibility to run sidecar containers. As seen on <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/container-apps/azure-resource-manager-api-spec?tabs=yaml#container-app-examples\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this example</a>, multiple containers can be defined for a deployment as if you would do in traditional Kubernetes deployment. However, Datadog's <a href=\"https://docs.datadoghq.com/serverless/azure_container_apps/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">documentation recommends installing the agent</a> in application container's image. That was the major reason why we ruled out Container Apps for now.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-option-4-falling-back-to-vanilla-app-services\">Option 4: Falling back to Vanilla App Services</h2>\n<p>It's really not an option while we consider containerisation for all the services and providing a shared deployment/instrumentation on local/dev/prod. It will definitely enable the APM and it is a well-paved road but it's not the road we want to fallback.</p>\n"}, {"tags": ["testing", "pr-environments"], "owner": {"account_id": 26683776, "reputation": 549, "user_id": 914, "user_type": "registered", "display_name": "Sander van Vliet", "link": "https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/users/914/sander-van-vliet"}, "comment_count": 0, "view_count": 20, "score": 2, "last_activity_date": 1686051141, "creation_date": 1686045260, "last_edit_date": 1686051141, "article_id": 23438, "article_type": "knowledge-article", "link": "https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/stack-overflow/articles/23438", "title": "Generate data for test environments", "body": "<p>A problem that people frequently run into is that when there is a need to test a feature that uses more than one Q/A combo it becomes super tedious to set that up and you end up spending loads of time just massaging the test data into place.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/StackEngLabs/TestDataGenerator\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Test Data Generator</a> allows you to create test data in a predictable way while still adding some randomness into the mix.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-how-does-it-work\">How does it work?</h2>\n<p>The Test Data Generator allows you to specify the rough <em>shape</em> of the test data you need and it will generate a set of JSON files that contains the full set of users, questions, answers, tags, departments.. basically everything needed to pretend you have an environment that was built up by users.</p>\n<p>These JSON files are consumed by the <code>import</code> command of the <a href=\"https://github.com/StackEng/StackOverflow/tree/main/utils/StackOverflow.Setup\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">StackOverflow.Setup</a> which will import that data into the environment of choice.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-current-features\">Current features</h2>\n<p>The application generates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Users + accounts</li>\n<li>Questions</li>\n<li>Answers</li>\n<li>Tags</li>\n<li>Departments</li>\n<li>Job titles</li>\n<li>OrgMemberDetails (links a user to a department and/or job title)</li>\n<li>Connections</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can control the volume and shape of the test data by setting these options</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Total number of users to create</li>\n<li>The start date of the site (used for the CreationDate of all users)</li>\n<li>The department / job title hierarchy</li>\n<li>The distribution of users across departments (even or randomized)</li>\n<li>The distribution of job titles in a department (even or randomized)</li>\n<li>The ratio of users to questions.

To make it very easy for them to do so <em>and</em> to allow for auto-scheduling of meetings, set working hours and the correct local timezone in Google Calendar:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/7638168?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Setting working hours</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37064?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop#zippy=%2Cchange-the-time-zone-for-all-your-calendars\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Setting primary timezone</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"heading-gcal-suggest-a-time\">GCal Suggest a Time</h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for open times for a meeting for you and a colleague, use Google\u2019s suggested time feature.</p>\n<p>In GCal, click Create &gt; Event &gt; More Options, and add the appropriate guests. Set the meeting to the right length of time, and then click \u201csuggested times\u201d underneath the guest list. You\u2019ll see an easy list of all of the times that people are 1) free and 2) in working hours. Pick one, and you\u2019re set. This is also great for generating a list of possible meeting times to send to a client, since you\u2019ll know both you and your AE are free at that time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-gcal-slack-integration\">GCal Slack Integration</h2>\n<p>GCal has a Slack integration that can message you your events for the day, update your Slack status to show you\u2019re in an event, and can ping you right before your meetings start. Open the Google Calendar app in Slack (cmd/ctrl + k, search for \u201cGoogle Calendar\u201d), and from there you can configure your preferences.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-install-zoom-gcal-add-on\">Install Zoom GCal Add-on</h2>\n<p>SEs use Zoom for client meetings (and meetings, generally).

Powerful enough, in fact, to lead to the creation of GitHub Copilot.</p>\n<p>Due to the growing interest in LLMs and generative AI models, we decided to speak to the researchers and engineers at GitHub who helped build the early versions of GitHub Copilot and talk through what it was like to work with different LLMs from OpenAI, and how model improvements have helped evolve GitHub Copilot to where it is today\u2014and beyond.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-a-brief-history-of-github-copilot\">A brief history of GitHub Copilot</h2>\n<p>In June 2020, OpenAI released GPT-3, an LLM that sparked intrigue in developer communities and beyond. Over at GitHub, this got the wheels turning for a project our engineers had only talked about before: code generation.</p>\n<p>\u201cEvery six months or so, someone would ask in our meetings, \u2018Should we think about general purpose code generation,\u2019 but the answer was always \u2018No, it\u2019s too difficult, the current models just can\u2019t do it,\u2019\u201d says <a href=\"https://github.com/wunderalbert\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Albert Ziegler</a>, a principal machine learning engineer and member of the <a href=\"https://githubnext.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">GitHub Next</a> research and development team.</p>\n<p>But GPT-3 changed all that\u2014suddenly the model was good enough to begin considering how a code generation tool might work.</p>\n<p>\u201cOpenAI gave us the API to play around with,\u201d Ziegler says. \u201cWe assessed it by giving it coding-like tasks and evaluated it in two different forms.\u201d</p>\n<p>For the first form of evaluation, the GitHub Next team crowdsourced self-contained problems to help test the model. \u201cThe reason we don\u2019t do this anymore is because the models just got too good,\u201d Ziegler laughs.</p>\n<p>In the beginning, the model could solve about half of the problems it was posed with, but soon enough, it was solving upwards of 90 percent of the problems.</p>\n<p>This original testing method sparked the first ideas for how to harness the power of this model, and they began to conceptualize an AI-powered chatbot for developers to ask coding questions and receive immediate, runnable code snippets. \u201cWe built a prototype, but it turned out there was a better modality for this technology available,\u201d Ziegler says. \u201cWe thought, \u2018Let\u2019s try to put this in the IDE.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe moment we did that and saw how well it worked, the whole static question-and-answer modality was forgotten,\u201d he says. \u201cThis new approach was interactive and it was useful in almost every situation.\u201d</p>\n<p>And with that, the development of <a href=\"https://github.com/features/copilot/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">GitHub Copilot</a> began.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-exploring-model-improvements\">Exploring model improvements</h2>\n<p>To keep this project moving forward, GitHub returned to OpenAI to make sure that they could stay on track with the latest models. \u201cThe first model that OpenAI gave us was a Python-only model,\u201d Ziegler remembers. \u201cNext we were delivered a JavaScript model and a multilingual model, and it turned out that the Javascript model had particular problems that the multilingual model did not. It actually came as a surprise to us that the multilingual model could perform so well. But each time, the models were just getting better and better, which was really exciting for GitHub Copilot\u2019s progress.\u201d</p>\n<p>In 2021, OpenAI released the multilingual <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Codex model</a>, which was built in partnership with GitHub. This model was an offshoot of GPT-3, so its original capability was generating natural language in response to text prompts. But what set the Codex model apart was that it was trained on billions of lines of public code\u2014so that, in addition to natural language outputs, it also produced code suggestions.</p>\n<p>This model was open for use via an API that businesses could build on, and while this breakthrough was huge for GitHub Copilot, the team needed to work on internal model improvements to ensure that it was as accurate as possible for end users.</p>\n<p>As the GitHub Copilot product was prepared for launch as a technical preview, the team split off into further functional teams, and the Model Improvements team became responsible for monitoring and improving GitHub Copilot\u2019s quality through communicating with the underlying LLM. This team also set out to work on improving completion for users. Completion refers to when users accept and keep GitHub Copilot suggestions in their code, and there are several different levers that the Model Improvements team works on to increase completion, including prompt crafting and fine tuning.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/copilot-llms-1.gif?w=548&amp;fit=1024%2C1024\" alt=\"An example of completion in action with GitHub Copilot\"></p>\n<p>An example of completion in action with GitHub Copilot.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-prompt-crafting\">Prompt crafting</h3>\n<p>When working with LLMs, you have to be very specific and intentional with your inputs to receive your desired output, and prompt crafting explores the art behind communicating these requests to get the optimal completion from the model.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn very simple terms, the LLM is, at its core, just a document completion model. For training it was given partial documents and it learned how to complete them one token at a time. Therefore, the art of prompt crafting is really all about creating a \u2018pseudo-document\u2019 that will lead the model to a completion that benefits the customer,\u201d <a href=\"https://github.com/jnbrymn\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">John Berryman</a>, a senior researcher of machine learning on the Model Improvements team explains. Since LLMs are trained on partial document completion, then if the partial document is code, then this completion capability lends itself well to code completion, which is, in its base form, exactly what GitHub Copilot does.</p>\n<p>To better understand how the model could be applied to code completion, the team would provide the model with a file and evaluate the code completions it returned.</p>\n<p>\u201cSometimes the results are ok, sometimes they are quite good, and sometimes the results seem almost magical,\u201d Berryman says. \u201cThe secret is that we don\u2019t just have to provide the model with the original file that the GitHub Copilot user is currently editing; instead we look for additional pieces of context inside the IDE that can hint the model towards better completions.\u201d</p>\n<p>He continues, \u201cThere have been several changes that helped get GitHub Copilot where it is today, but one of my favorite tricks was when we pulled similar texts in from the user\u2019s neighboring editor tabs. That was a huge lift in our acceptance rate and characters retained.\u201d</p>\n<p>Generative AI and LLMs are incredibly fascinating, but Berryman still seems to be most excited about the benefit that the users are seeing from the research and engineering efforts.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe idea here is to make sure that we make developers more productive, but the way we do that is where things start to get interesting: we can make the user more productive by incorporating the way they think about code into the algorithm itself,\u201d Berryman says. \u201cWhere the developer might flip back and forth between tabs to reference code, we just can do that for them, and the completion is exactly what it would be if the user had taken all of the time to look that information up.\u201d</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-fine-tuning\">Fine-tuning</h3>\n<p>Fine-tuning is a technique used in AI to adapt and improve a pre-trained model for a specific task or domain. The process involves taking a pre-trained model that has been trained on a large dataset and training it on a smaller, more specific dataset that is relevant to a particular use case. This enables the model to learn and adapt to the nuances of the new data, thus improving its performance on the specific task.</p>\n<p>These larger, more sophisticated LLMs can sometimes produce outputs that aren\u2019t necessarily helpful because it\u2019s hard to statistically define what constitutes a \u201cgood\u201d response. It\u2019s also incredibly difficult to train a model like Codex that contains upwards of 170 billion parameters.</p>\n<p>\u201cBasically, we\u2019re training the underlying Codex model on a user\u2019s specific codebase to provide more focused, customized completions,\u201d Goudarzi adds.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur greatest challenge right now is to consider why the user rejects or accepts a suggestion,\u201d Goudarzi adds. \u201cWe have to consider what context, or information, that we served to the model caused the model to output something that was either helpful or not helpful. There\u2019s no way for us to really troubleshoot in the typical engineering way, but what we can do is figure out how to ask the right questions to get the output we desire.\u201d</p>\n"}], "tags": [{"description": "Zuora is Stack Overflow's billing system.
