        "body_markdown": "Technical Explanation\r\n\r\nThis document hopes to answer the question: &quot;What *is* Remix?&quot; Remix is four things:\r\n\r\n1. A compiler\r\n\r\n2. A server-side HTTP handler\r\n\r\n3. A server framework\r\n\r\n4. A browser framework\r\n\r\nWhen all four of these things know about each other, you can do some pretty interesting things.\r\n\r\nWe often describe Remix as &quot;a compiler for React Router&quot; because everything about Remix takes advantage of nested routes. App developers add files to `app/routes/*` and then Remix takes off from there.\r\n\r\n## Compiler\r\n\r\nEverything in Remix starts with the compiler: `remix build`. Using [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/), this creates a few things:\r\n\r\n1. A server HTTP handler, usually in `server/build/index.js` (it&#39;s configurable) that includes all routes and modules together to be able to render on the server and handle any other server-side requests for resources.\r\n\r\n2. A browser build, usually in `public/build/*`. This includes automatic code splitting by route, fingerprinted asset imports (like CSS and images), etc. Anything needed to run an application in the browser.\r\n\r\n3. An asset manifest. Both the client and the server use this manifest to know the entire dependency graph. This is useful for preloading resources in the initial server render as well as prefetching them for client-side transitions. This is how Remix is able to eliminate the render+fetch waterfalls so common in web apps today.\r\n\r\nWith these build artifacts, an application can be deployed to any hosting service that runs JavaScript.\r\n\r\n## HTTP Handler and Adapters\r\n\r\nWhile Remix runs on the server, it is not actually a server. It&#39;s just a handler that is given to an actual JavaScript server.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s built on the [Web Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) instead of Node.js. This enables Remix to run in any Node.js server like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Netlify](https://netlify.com/), [Architect](https://arc.codes/), etc. as well as non-Node.js environments like [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) and [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy/docs).\r\n\r\nThis is what Remix looks like when running in an express app:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst remix = require(&quot;@remix-run/express&quot;);\r\nconst express = require(&quot;express&quot;);\r\n\r\nconst app = express();\r\n\r\napp.all(\r\n  &quot;*&quot;,\r\n  remix.createRequestHandler({ build: require(&quot;./build&quot;) })\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nCopy code to clipboard\r\n\r\nExpress (or Node.js) is the actual server, Remix is just a handler on that server. The `&quot;@remix-run/express&quot;` package is called an adapter. Remix handlers are server agnostic. Adapters make them work for a specific server by converting the server&#39;s request/response API into the Fetch API on the way in, and then adapting the Fetch Response coming from Remix into the server&#39;s response API. Here&#39;s some pseudo code of what an adapter does:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport function createRequestHandler({ build }) {\r\n  // creates a Fetch API request handler from the server build\r\n  const handleRequest = createRemixRequestHandler(build);\r\n\r\n  // returns an express.js specific handler for the express server\r\n  return async (req, res) =&gt; {\r\n    // adapts the express.req to a Fetch API request\r\n    const request = createRemixRequest(req);\r\n\r\n    // calls the app handler and receives a Fetch API response\r\n    const response = await handleRequest(request);\r\n\r\n    // adapts the Fetch API response to the express.res\r\n    sendRemixResponse(res, response);\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCopy code to clipboard\r\n\r\nReal adapters do a bit more than that, but that&#39;s the gist of it. Not only does this enable you to deploy Remix anywhere, but it also lets you incrementally adopt it in an existing JavaScript server since you can have routes outside of Remix that your server continues to handle before getting to Remix.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if Remix doesn&#39;t have an adapter for your server already, you can look at the source of one of the adapters and build your own.\r\n\r\n## Server Framework\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re familiar with server-side MVC web frameworks like Rails and Laravel, Remix is the View and Controller, but it leaves the Model up to you. There are a lot of great databases, ORMs, mailers, etc. in the JavaScript ecosystem to fill that space. Remix also has helpers around the Fetch API for cookie and session management.\r\n\r\nInstead of having a split between View and Controller, Remix Route modules take on both responsibilities.\r\n\r\nMost server-side frameworks are &quot;model focused&quot;. A controller manages *multiple URLs* for a single model.\r\n\r\nRemix is *UI focused*. Routes can handle an entire URL or just a segment of the URL. When a route maps to just a segment, the nested URL segments become nested layouts in the UI. In this way, each layout (view) can be its own controller and then Remix will aggregate the data and components to build the complete UI.\r\n\r\nMore often than not, a Remix route module can contain both the UI and the interactions with the models in the same file, which leads to really nice developer ergonomics and productivity.\r\n\r\nRoute modules have three primary exports: `loader`, `action`, and `default` (component).\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Loaders only run on the server and provide data\r\n// to your component on GET requests\r\nexport async function loader() {\r\n  return json(await db.projects.findAll());\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Actions only run on the server and handle POST\r\n// PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. They can also provide data\r\n// to the component\r\nexport async function action({ request }: ActionArgs) {\r\n  const form = await request.formData();\r\n  const errors = validate(form);\r\n  if (errors) {\r\n    return json({ errors });\r\n  }\r\n  await createProject({ title: form.get(&quot;title&quot;) });\r\n  return json({ ok: true });\r\n}\r\n\r\n// The default export is the component that will be\r\n// rendered when a route matches the URL. This runs\r\n// both on the server and the client\r\nexport default function Projects() {\r\n  const projects = useLoaderData&lt;typeof loader&gt;();\r\n  const actionData = useActionData&lt;typeof action&gt;();\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;div&gt;\r\n      {projects.map((project) =&gt; (\r\n        &lt;Link key={project.slug} to={project.slug}&gt;\r\n          {project.title}\r\n        &lt;/Link&gt;\r\n      ))}\r\n\r\n      &lt;Form method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;input name=&quot;title&quot; /&gt;\r\n        &lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;Create New Project&lt;/button&gt;\r\n      &lt;/Form&gt;\r\n      {actionData?.errors ? (\r\n        &lt;ErrorMessages errors={actionData.errors} /&gt;\r\n      ) : null}\r\n\r\n      {/* outlets render the nested child routes\r\n          that match the URL deeper than this route,\r\n          allowing each layout to co-locate the UI and\r\n          controller code in the same file */}\r\n      &lt;Outlet /&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCopy code to clipboard\r\n\r\nYou can actually use Remix as just a server-side framework without using any browser JavaScript at all. The route conventions for data loading with `loader`, mutations with `action` and HTML forms, and components that render at URLs, can provide the core feature set of a lot of web projects.\r\n\r\nIn this way, **Remix scales down**. Not every page in your application needs a bunch of JavaScript in the browser and not every user interaction requires any extra flair than the browser&#39;s default behaviors. In Remix you can build it the simple way first, and then scale up without changing the fundamental model. Additionally, the majority of the app works before JavaScript loads in the browser, which makes Remix apps resilient to choppy network conditions by design.\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re not familiar with traditional back-end web frameworks, you can think of Remix routes as React components that are already their own API route and already know how to load and submit data to themselves on the server.\r\n\r\n## Browser Framework\r\n\r\nOnce Remix has served the document to the browser, it &quot;hydrates&quot; the page with the browser build&#39;s JavaScript modules. This is where we talk a lot about Remix &quot;emulating the browser&quot;.\r\n\r\nWhen the user clicks a link, instead of making a round trip to the server for the entire document and all of the assets, Remix simply fetches the data for the next page and updates the UI. This has many performance benefits over making a full-document request:\r\n\r\n1. Assets don&#39;t need to be re-downloaded (or pulled from cache)\r\n\r\n2. Assets don&#39;t need to be parsed by the browser again\r\n\r\n3. The data fetched is much smaller than the entire document (sometimes orders of magnitude)\r\n\r\nRemix also has some built in optimizations for client-side navigation. It knows which layouts will persist between the two URLs, so it only fetches the data for the ones that are changing. A full document request would require all data to be fetched on the server, wasting resources on your back end and slowing down your app.\r\n\r\nThis approach also has UX benefits like not resetting the scroll position of a sidebar nav and allowing you to move focus to something that makes more sense than the top of the document.\r\n\r\nRemix can also prefetch all resources for a page when the user is about to click a link. The browser framework knows about the compiler&#39;s asset manifest. It can match the URL of the link, read the manifest, and then prefetch all data, JavaScript modules, and even CSS resources for the next page. This is how Remix apps feel fast even when networks are slow.\r\n\r\nRemix then provides client side APIs so you can create rich user experiences without changing the fundamental model of HTML and browsers.\r\n\r\nTaking our route module from before, here are a few small, but useful UX improvements to the form that you can only do with JavaScript in the browser:\r\n\r\n1. Disable the button when the form is being submitted\r\n\r\n2. Focus the input when server-side form validation fails\r\n\r\n3. Animate in the error messages\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport default function Projects() {\r\n  const projects = useLoaderData&lt;typeof loader&gt;();\r\n  const actionData = useActionData&lt;typeof action&gt;();\r\n  const { state } = useNavigation();\r\n  const busy = state === &quot;submitting&quot;;\r\n  const inputRef = React.useRef();\r\n\r\n  React.useEffect(() =&gt; {\r\n    if (actionData.errors) {\r\n      inputRef.current.focus();\r\n    }\r\n  }, [actionData]);\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;div&gt;\r\n      {projects.map((project) =&gt; (\r\n        &lt;Link key={project.slug} to={project.slug}&gt;\r\n          {project.title}\r\n        &lt;/Link&gt;\r\n      ))}\r\n\r\n      &lt;Form method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;input ref={inputRef} name=&quot;title&quot; /&gt;\r\n        &lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot; disabled={busy}&gt;\r\n          {busy ? &quot;Creating...&quot; : &quot;Create New Project&quot;}\r\n        &lt;/button&gt;\r\n      &lt;/Form&gt;\r\n\r\n      {actionData?.errors ? (\r\n        &lt;FadeIn&gt;\r\n          &lt;ErrorMessages errors={actionData.errors} /&gt;\r\n        &lt;/FadeIn&gt;\r\n      ) : null}\r\n\r\n      &lt;Outlet /&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat&#39;s most interesting about this code sample is that it is **only additive**. The entire interaction is still fundamentally the same thing.\r\n\r\nBecause Remix reaches into the controller level of the backend, it can do this seamlessly.\r\n\r\nAnd while it doesn&#39;t reach as far back into the stack as server-side frameworks like Rails and Laravel, it does reach way farther up the stack into the browser to make the transition from the back end to the front end seamless.\r\n\r\nFor example. Building a plain HTML form and server-side handler in a back-end heavy web framework is just as easy to do as it is in Remix. But as soon as you want to cross over into an experience with animated validation messages, focus management, and pending UI, it requires a fundamental change in the code. Typically people build an API route and then bring in a splash of client-side JavaScript to connect the two. With Remix you simply add some code around the existing &quot;server side view&quot; without changing how it works fundamentally.\r\n\r\nWe borrowed an old term and called this Progressive Enhancement in Remix. Start small with a plain HTML form (Remix scales down) and then scale the UI up when you have the time and ambition.",

A controller manages <em>multiple URLs</em> for a single model.</p>\n<p>Remix is <em>UI focused</em>. Routes can handle an entire URL or just a segment of the URL. When a route maps to just a segment, the nested URL segments become nested layouts in the UI. In this way, each layout (view) can be its own controller and then Remix will aggregate the data and components to build the complete UI.</p>\n<p>More often than not, a Remix route module can contain both the UI and the interactions with the models in the same file, which leads to really nice developer ergonomics and productivity.</p>\n<p>Route modules have three primary exports: <code>loader</code>, <code>action</code>, and <code>default</code> (component).</p>\n<pre><code>// Loaders only run on the server and provide data\n// to your component on GET requests\nexport async function loader() {\n  return json(await db.projects.findAll());\n}\n\n// Actions only run on the server and handle POST\n// PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. They can also provide data\n// to the component\nexport async function action({ request }: ActionArgs) {\n  const form = await request.formData();\n  const errors = validate(form);\n  if (errors) {\n    return json({ errors });\n  }\n  await createProject({ title: form.get(&quot;title&quot;) });\n  return json({ ok: true });\n}\n\n// The default export is the component that will be\n// rendered when a route matches the URL. This runs\n// both on the server and the client\nexport default function Projects() {\n  const projects = useLoaderData&lt;typeof loader&gt;();\n  const actionData = useActionData&lt;typeof action&gt;();\n\n  return (\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      {projects.map((project) =&gt; (\n        &lt;Link key={project.slug} to={project.slug}&gt;\n          {project.title}\n        &lt;/Link&gt;\n      ))}\n\n      &lt;Form method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;input name=&quot;title&quot; /&gt;\n        &lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;Create New Project&lt;/button&gt;\n      &lt;/Form&gt;\n      {actionData?.errors ? (\n        &lt;ErrorMessages errors={actionData.errors} /&gt;\n      ) : null}\n\n      {/* outlets render the nested child routes\n          that match the URL deeper than this route,\n          allowing each layout to co-locate the UI and\n          controller code in the same file */}\n      &lt;Outlet /&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Copy code to clipboard</p>\n<p>You can actually use Remix as just a server-side framework without using any browser JavaScript at all. The route conventions for data loading with <code>loader</code>, mutations with <code>action</code> and HTML forms, and components that render at URLs, can provide the core feature set of a lot of web projects.</p>\n<p>In this way, <strong>Remix scales down</strong>. Not every page in your application needs a bunch of JavaScript in the browser and not every user interaction requires any extra flair than the browser's default behaviors. In Remix you can build it the simple way first, and then scale up without changing the fundamental model. Additionally, the majority of the app works before JavaScript loads in the browser, which makes Remix apps resilient to choppy network conditions by design.</p>\n<p>If you're not familiar with traditional back-end web frameworks, you can think of Remix routes as React components that are already their own API route and already know how to load and submit data to themselves on the server.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-browser-framework\">Browser Framework</h2>\n<p>Once Remix has served the document to the browser, it &quot;hydrates&quot; the page with the browser build's JavaScript modules. This is where we talk a lot about Remix &quot;emulating the browser&quot;.</p>\n<p>When the user clicks a link, instead of making a round trip to the server for the entire document and all of the assets, Remix simply fetches the data for the next page and updates the UI. This has many performance benefits over making a full-document request:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Assets don't need to be re-downloaded (or pulled from cache)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Assets don't need to be parsed by the browser again</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The data fetched is much smaller than the entire document (sometimes orders of magnitude)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Remix also has some built in optimizations for client-side navigation. It knows which layouts will persist between the two URLs, so it only fetches the data for the ones that are changing. A full document request would require all data to be fetched on the server, wasting resources on your back end and slowing down your app.</p>\n<p>This approach also has UX benefits like not resetting the scroll position of a sidebar nav and allowing you to move focus to something that makes more sense than the top of the document.</p>\n<p>Remix can also prefetch all resources for a page when the user is about to click a link. The browser framework knows about the compiler's asset manifest. It can match the URL of the link, read the manifest, and then prefetch all data, JavaScript modules, and even CSS resources for the next page. This is how Remix apps feel fast even when networks are slow.</p>\n<p>Remix then provides client side APIs so you can create rich user experiences without changing the fundamental model of HTML and browsers.</p>\n<p>Taking our route module from before, here are a few small, but useful UX improvements to the form that you can only do with JavaScript in the browser:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Disable the button when the form is being submitted</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Focus the input when server-side form validation fails</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Animate in the error messages</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>export default function Projects() {\n  const projects = useLoaderData&lt;typeof loader&gt;();\n  const actionData = useActionData&lt;typeof action&gt;();\n  const { state } = useNavigation();\n  const busy = state === &quot;submitting&quot;;\n  const inputRef = React.useRef();\n\n  React.useEffect(() =&gt; {\n    if (actionData.errors) {\n      inputRef.current.focus();\n    }\n  }, [actionData]);\n\n  return (\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      {projects.map((project) =&gt; (\n        &lt;Link key={project.slug} to={project.slug}&gt;\n          {project.title}\n        &lt;/Link&gt;\n      ))}\n\n      &lt;Form method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;input ref={inputRef} name=&quot;title&quot; /&gt;\n        &lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot; disabled={busy}&gt;\n          {busy ? &quot;Creating...&quot; : &quot;Create New Project&quot;}\n        &lt;/button&gt;\n      &lt;/Form&gt;\n\n      {actionData?.errors ? (\n        &lt;FadeIn&gt;\n          &lt;ErrorMessages errors={actionData.errors} /&gt;\n        &lt;/FadeIn&gt;\n      ) : null}\n\n      &lt;Outlet /&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>What's most interesting about this code sample is that it is <strong>only additive</strong>. The entire interaction is still fundamentally the same thing.</p>\n<p>Because Remix reaches into the controller level of the backend, it can do this seamlessly.</p>\n<p>And while it doesn't reach as far back into the stack as server-side frameworks like Rails and Laravel, it does reach way farther up the stack into the browser to make the transition from the back end to the front end seamless.</p>\n<p>For example. Building a plain HTML form and server-side handler in a back-end heavy web framework is just as easy to do as it is in Remix. But as soon as you want to cross over into an experience with animated validation messages, focus management, and pending UI, it requires a fundamental change in the code. Typically people build an API route and then bring in a splash of client-side JavaScript to connect the two. With Remix you simply add some code around the existing &quot;server side view&quot; without changing how it works fundamentally.</p>\n<p>We borrowed an old term and called this Progressive Enhancement in Remix. Start small with a plain HTML form (Remix scales down) and then scale the UI up when you have the time and ambition.</p>\n"

Therefore, used manually, they can grow very big and are then often hard to draw fully by hand. Traditionally, decision trees have been created manually \u2013 as the aside example shows \u2013 although increasingly, specialized software is employed.\r\n\r\nDecision rules\r\nThe decision tree can be linearized into decision rules,\\[2\\] where the outcome is the contents of the leaf node, and the conditions along the path form a conjunction in the if clause. In general, the rules have the form:\r\n\r\nif condition1 and condition2 and condition3 then outcome.\r\nDecision rules can be generated by constructing association rules with the target variable on the right. They can also denote temporal or causal relations.\\[3\\]\r\n\r\nClick [here](https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/demo/questions/601) for more context.",

Therefore, used manually, they can grow very big and are then often hard to draw fully by hand. Traditionally, decision trees have been created manually \u2013 as the aside example shows \u2013 although increasingly, specialized software is employed.</p>\n<p>Decision rules\nThe decision tree can be linearized into decision rules,[2] where the outcome is the contents of the leaf node, and the conditions along the path form a conjunction in the if clause. In general, the rules have the form:</p>\n<p>if condition1 and condition2 and condition3 then outcome.\nDecision rules can be generated by constructing association rules with the target variable on the right. They can also denote temporal or causal relations.[3]</p>\n<p>Click <a href=\"https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/demo/questions/601\">here</a> for more context.</p>\n"

Using Terraform, you create configuration files using&#160;[HCL syntax](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/syntax.html). The HCL syntax allows you to specify the cloud provider - such as Azure - and the elements that make up your cloud infrastructure. After you create your configuration files, you create an&#160;*execution plan*&#160;that allows you to preview your infrastructure changes before they&#39;re deployed. Once you verify the changes, you apply the execution plan to deploy the infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThis article shows how to create an Azure resource group using Terraform.\r\n\r\nIn this article, you learn how to:\r\n\r\n- Create an Azure resource group to hold other Azure resources\r\n\r\n- Verify (using Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell) the resource group was created\r\n\r\n- Delete the resource group when finished using it\r\n\r\n# 1. Configure your environment\r\n\r\n- **Azure subscription**: If you don&#39;t have an Azure subscription, create a&#160;[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&amp;utm_source=microsoft.com&amp;utm_medium=docs&amp;utm_campaign=visualstudio)&#160;before you begin.\r\n\r\n- **Configure Terraform:**&#160;If you haven&#39;t already done so, configure Terraform using one of the following options:\r\n\r\n  - [Configure Terraform in Azure Cloud Shell with Bash](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/terraform/get-started-cloud-shell-bash)\r\n\r\n  - [Configure Terraform in Azure Cloud Shell with PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/terraform/get-started-cloud-shell-powershell)\r\n\r\n  - [Configure Terraform in Windows with Bash](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/terraform/get-started-windows-bash)\r\n\r\n  - [Configure Terraform in Windows with PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/terraform/get-started-windows-powershell)\r\n\r\n# 2. Implement the Terraform code\r\n\r\n1. Create a directory in which to test the sample Terraform code and make it the current directory.\r\n\r\n2. Create a file named&#160;`main.tf`&#160;and insert the following code:\r\n\r\n   terraform {\r\n\r\n   required_version = &quot;\\&gt;=0.12&quot;\r\n\r\n   required_providers {\r\n   azurerm = {\r\n   source = &quot;hashicorp/azurerm&quot;\r\n   version = &quot;\\~\\&gt;2.0&quot;\r\n   }\r\n   }\r\n   }\r\n\r\n   provider &quot;azurerm&quot; {\r\n   features {}\r\n   }\r\n\r\n   resource &quot;random_pet&quot; &quot;rg-name&quot; {\r\n   prefix    = var.resource_group_name_prefix\r\n   }\r\n\r\n   resource &quot;azurerm_resource_group&quot; &quot;rg&quot; {\r\n   name      = random_pet.rg-name.id\r\n   location  = var.resource_group_location\r\n   }\r\n\r\n3\\. Create a file named&#160;`variables.tf`&#160;to contain the project variables and insert the following code:\r\n\r\n    variable &quot;resource_group_name_prefix&quot; {\r\n      default       = &quot;rg&quot;\r\n      description   = &quot;Prefix of the resource group name that&#39;s combined with a random ID so name is unique in your Azure subscription.&quot;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    variable &quot;resource_group_location&quot; {\r\n      default = &quot;eastus&quot;\r\n      description   = &quot;Location of the resource group.&quot;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n4\\. Create a file named&#160;`output.tf`&#160;to display the randomly generated resource group name and insert the following code:\r\n\r\n    output &quot;resource_group_name&quot; {\r\n        value = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name\r\n    }\r\n\r\n# 3. Initialize Terraform\r\n\r\nRun&#160;[terraform init](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/init.html)&#160;to initialize the Terraform deployment. This command downloads the Azure modules required to manage your Azure resources.\r\n\r\n    terraform init\r\n\r\n# 4. Create a Terraform execution plan\r\n\r\nRun&#160;[terraform plan](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/plan.html)&#160;to create an execution plan.\r\n\r\n    terraform plan -out main.tfplan\r\n\r\n**Key points:**\r\n\r\n- The&#160;`terraform plan`&#160;command creates an execution plan, but doesn&#39;t execute it. Instead, it determines what actions are necessary to create the configuration specified in your configuration files. This pattern allows you to verify whether the execution plan matches your expectations before making any changes to actual resources.\r\n\r\n- The optional&#160;`-out`&#160;parameter allows you to specify an output file for the plan. Using the&#160;`-out`&#160;parameter ensures that the plan you reviewed is exactly what is applied.\r\n\r\n- To read more about persisting execution plans and security, see the&#160;[security warning section](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/plan.html#security-warning).\r\n\r\n# 5. Apply a Terraform execution plan\r\n\r\nRun&#160;[terraform apply](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/apply.html)&#160;to apply the execution plan to your cloud infrastructure.\r\n\r\n    terraform apply main.tfplan\r\n\r\n**Key points:**\r\n\r\n- The&#160;`terraform apply`&#160;command above assumes you previously ran&#160;`terraform plan -out main.tfplan`.\r\n\r\n- If you specified a different filename for the&#160;`-out`&#160;parameter, use that same filename in the call to&#160;`terraform apply`.\r\n\r\n- If you didn&#39;t use the&#160;`-out`&#160;parameter, simply call&#160;`terraform apply`&#160;without any parameters.\r\n\r\n# 6. Verify the results\r\n\r\nRun&#160;[az group show](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/group#az_group_show)&#160;to display the resource group.\r\n\r\n    az group show --name &lt;resource_group_name&gt;\r\n\r\n**Key points:**\r\n\r\n- The resource group name is displayed in the&#160;`terraform apply`&#160;output.\r\n\r\n# 7. Clean up resources\r\n\r\nWhen you no longer need the resources created via Terraform, do the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. Run&#160;[terraform plan](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/plan.html)&#160;and specify the&#160;`destroy`&#160;flag.\r\n\r\n   terraform plan -destroy -out main.destroy.tfplan\r\n\r\n**Key points:**\r\n\r\n- The&#160;`terraform plan`&#160;command creates an execution plan, but doesn&#39;t execute it. Instead, it determines what actions are necessary to create the configuration specified in your configuration files. This pattern allows you to verify whether the execution plan matches your expectations before making any changes to actual resources.\r\n\r\n- The optional&#160;`-out`&#160;parameter allows you to specify an output file for the plan. Using the&#160;`-out`&#160;parameter ensures that the plan you reviewed is exactly what is applied.\r\n\r\n- To read more about persisting execution plans and security, see the&#160;[security warning section](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/plan.html#security-warning).\r\n\r\n2\\. Run&#160;[terraform apply](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/apply.html)&#160;to apply the execution plan.\r\n\r\n    terraform apply main.destroy.tfplan\r\n\r\n# Troubleshoot Terraform on Azure\r\n\r\n[Troubleshoot common problems when using Terraform on Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/terraform/troubleshoot)\r\n\r\n# Next steps\r\n\r\n**[Learn more about using Terraform in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/terraform)**",

You can either create a VPN profile on your own or set up a work account to get a VPN profile from your company.\r\n\r\nBefore you start:\r\n\r\n- If it\u2019s for work, look for VPN settings or a VPN app on your company\u2019s intranet site&#160;while you\u2019re at work, or contact your company&#39;s support person.\r\n\r\n- If it\u2019s for a VPN service you subscribe to for&#160;personal use, visit&#160;the Microsoft Store &#160;to see if there\u2019s an app for that service,&#160;then go to the VPN service\u2019s website to see if the VPN connection settings to use are listed there.\r\n\r\n1. Select the&#160;**Start**&#160;button, then type **settings**. Select&#160;**Settings**&#160;\\&gt;&#160;**Network &amp; internet**&#160;\\&gt;&#160;**VPN**&#160;\\&gt;&#160;**Add VPN**.\r\n\r\n2. In&#160;**Add a VPN connection**, do the following:\r\n\r\n   - For&#160;**VPN provider**, choose&#160;**Windows (built-in)**.\r\n\r\n   - In the&#160;**Connection name**&#160;box, enter a name you&#39;ll recognize (for example, My&#160;Personal VPN). This is the VPN connection name you&#39;ll look for when connecting.\r\n\r\n   - In the&#160;**Server name or address**&#160;box, enter the address for the VPN server.\r\n\r\n   - For&#160;**VPN type**, choose the type of VPN connection you want to create. You\u2019ll need to know which kind of VPN connection your company or VPN service uses.\r\n\r\n   - For&#160;**Type of sign-in info**, choose the type of sign-in info (or credentials) to use. This&#160;might be a username and password, one-time password, certificate, or a smart card if you\u2019re connecting to a VPN for work. Enter your username and password in the respective boxes (if required).\r\n\r\n3. Select&#160;**Save**.\r\n\r\n4. If you need to edit the VPN connection info or specify additional settings, such as proxy settings, choose the VPN connection and then select&#160;**Advanced options**.\r\n\r\n## Connect to a VPN\r\n\r\nWhen&#160;you have a VPN profile, you\u2019re ready to connect.\r\n\r\n1. In Settings, select **Network &amp; internet**&#160;\\&gt;&#160;**VPN.**\r\n\r\n2. Next to the VPN connection you want to use, select **Connect**.\r\n\r\n3. If you&#39;re prompted, enter your username and password or other sign-in info.\r\n\r\nWhen connected, the VPN connection name will&#160;display&#160;**Connected**&#160;underneath it. To see if you\u2019re connected to the VPN while you\u2019re doing things on your PC, hover your mouse pointer over the **Network**&#160;icon&#160;on the far right of the taskbar, then see if the VPN connection&#160;shows.",

The API can record purchase items, calculate totals, confirm payment, track an order&#39;s progress through fulfillment, and update a catalog inventory.\r\n\r\nWith the Orders API, you can build web and mobile applications that use orders to manage purchase item information, track order fulfillment, integrate customer data, and link payments. You can also create fulfillment orders and send them to the Square Point of Sale application for fulfillment.\r\n\r\n#### Important\r\n\r\nIf you use the Square Orders API with a non-Square payments provider, Square charges a transaction fee. For more information, see&#160;[Orders API fee structure.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/payments-pricing#orders-api-fee-structure)\r\n\r\n## \r\n\r\n## Orders components\r\n\r\nThe Orders API works with the following key data types:\r\n\r\n- `Order`. The top-level container for order information. Order objects include fields for line item details, fulfillment details, and order summary data, including the location ID credited with the order and the total amount of taxes collected.\r\n\r\n- `OrderLineItem`. Represents a purchase item (for example, a coffee or T-shirt). Each line item has a&#160;`OrderLineItemModifier`&#160;that represents an available size or color. Items and modifiers can be built from Catalog objects or they can be defined ad hoc (at the time of creation).\r\n\r\n- `OrderLineItemDiscount`&#160;and&#160;`OrderLineItemTax`. A price modifier that can be applied at the order or line item level. Taxes and discounts can be configured as Catalog objects and referenced in the order or they can be created ad hoc.\r\n\r\n- `OrderFulfillment`. Contains details about how to fulfill this order, such as the customer name or the time at which the customer should pick up the order. Order objects made with fulfillments are pushed to the Square Seller Dashboard when charged, so sellers can manage order fulfillment in the Square Point of Sale application.\r\n\r\n- `OrderSource`. Tracks the digital or physical source of the order. Orders can be searched or retrieved by the source.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see&#160;[Orders objects and data types.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/orders-api/how-it-works#orders-objects-and-datatypes)\r\n\r\n## \r\n\r\n## Integrating with the Orders API\r\n\r\nThe Orders API integrates seamlessly with other Square APIs and resources to expand the functionality of your application.\r\n\r\n### \r\n\r\n### Square Point of Sale\r\n\r\nOrders with fulfillment that have been fully paid are pushed to the Square Point of Sale application, so that sellers can manage fulfillment with the Square Point of Sale application. The Orders API currently supports two types of fulfillment orders: Pickup and Shipment. For more information, see&#160;[Add fulfillment details.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/orders-api/create-orders#add-fulfillment-details)\r\n\r\n### \r\n\r\n### Payments\r\n\r\nLink your payments to Order objects to itemize sales and apply price modifiers such as taxes, discounts, and service charges. You can also use the Orders API to retrieve any payment activity associated with a sale, whether from the Square Point of Sale application, invoices, or an integration build with the Payments API and Orders API.&#160;For more information, see&#160;[Pay for Orders.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/orders-api/pay-for-orders)\r\n\r\n### \r\n\r\n### Catalog\r\n\r\nLine items, line item modifiers, taxes, and discounts can all be defined as catalog objects. The Orders API reaches its full range of capabilities when orders are built using Square&#160;[catalog objects.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/catalog-api/what-it-does)\r\n\r\nKey advantages to using catalog items include:\r\n\r\n- Orders that reference catalog IDs for taxes and discounts are automatically calculated and applied these price modifiers.\r\n\r\n- Orders that reference catalog line items use details defined in the catalog, such as the item name and price.\r\n\r\n- When these orders are closed, Square updates the inventory for those items.\r\n\r\nTake some time to&#160;[set up your catalog with the Catalog API&#160;](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/catalog-api/build-with-catalog)to unlock the full range of capabilities from the Orders API. For more information, see&#160;[Create Orders.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/orders-api/create-orders)\r\n\r\n#### Did you know?\r\n\r\nOrders can also be built from ad hoc line items defined at the time of Order object creation. You need to supply an item name and price.\r\n\r\n### \r\n\r\n### Customers\r\n\r\nOrder objects can reference a customer profile. You can later use&#160;`SearchOrders`&#160;to search orders by customer. For more information about making customer profiles, see&#160;[Keep Records of Customer Profiles.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/customers-api/use-the-api/keep-records)\r\n\r\n#### Important\r\n\r\nThe Orders API integration with the Customers API is in beta. For more information about known beta issues, see&#160;[the changelog.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/changelog/connect-logs/2019-08-15)\r\n\r\n#### \r\n\r\n#### Customer assignments for orders and payments\r\n\r\nIn the Seller Dashboard, transaction activity is based on the&#160;`customer_id`&#160;of the order and other related settings, but the&#160;`customer_id`&#160;of the payment is ignored. For example, if the order does not have a customer assignment, the transaction&#39;s&#160;**Paid by**&#160;field might not display the customer who is assigned to the payment. To reliably link transactions to customers in the Seller Dashboard, make sure to specify the&#160;`customer_id`&#160;field in your&#160;`CreateOrder`&#160;request.\r\n\r\nIn addition, omitting this field on the&#160;`Order`&#160;object might result in the creation of new&#160;[instant profiles&#160;](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/customers-api/what-it-does?preview=true#instant-profiles)that are linked to the payment.\r\n\r\n## Related topics\r\n\r\n- [Create Orders](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/orders-api/create-orders)\r\n\r\n- [Pay for Orders](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/orders-api/pay-for-orders)\r\n\r\n- [Manage Orders](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/orders-api/manage-orders)\r\n\r\n- [Video: Manage orders with the Orders API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sldn3byppJU&amp;t=5s)",

        "body_markdown": "**Part 1:** Rig Site Preparation\r\n\r\n[![Image titled Drill an Oil Well Step 1](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/28/Drill-an-Oil-Well-Step-1-Version-2.jpg/aid1441331-v4-728px-Drill-an-Oil-Well-Step-1-Version-2.jpg.webp)](https://www.wikihow.com/Drill-an-Oil-Well#/Image:Drill-an-Oil-Well-Step-1-Version-2.jpg)\r\n\r\n1. **Identify the drilling site.** New oil fields are most easily found where oil is already being drilled. There are a number of ways to test for oil.\r\n\r\n- Soil gas surveys can assist in the discovery of oil. These surveys measure a soil sample for trace amounts of light hydrocarbons (the tell-tale chemical signals of oil). Soil gas surveys should be the first option when investigating whether a region contains oil because the test is relatively low-cost.[&lt;sup&gt;\\[1\\]&lt;/sup&gt;](https://www.wikihow.com/Drill-an-Oil-Well#_note-1)\r\n\r\n- Seismic imaging can also help locate oil deposits. Seismologists, armed with devices known as geophones, can bounce sound waves off underground rock and listen to the echoes the sound waves produce. Analyzing the echo patterns can provide accurate imagery of subsurface geology, including pockets of oil and other fossil fuels.\r\n\r\n[![Image titled Drill an Oil Well Step 2](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f9/Drill-an-Oil-Well-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/aid1441331-v4-728px-Drill-an-Oil-Well-Step-2-Version-2.jpg.webp)](https://www.wikihow.com/Drill-an-Oil-Well#/Image:Drill-an-Oil-Well-Step-2-Version-2.jpg)\r\n\r\n**2. Draft a drilling proposal.** After conducting the requisite research, an oil company should consider potential complications with their drilling plan and address them in their proposal. How much money is allocated for the drilling project? How long is the well expected to be productive? What is the desired return on investment?\r\n\r\n- Ask hard questions and try to anticipate specific dates for key events -- such as the full assembly of the oil rig, commencement of oil production, and well abandonment -- over the course of the well&#39;s life.\r\n\r\n- Conduct research into the oil market. There are lots of alternatives to oil today, including solar, electric, and biofuels. Consider recent trends in the price of oil and use it determine if drilling a new oil well is a sound investment. Is there a glut (overproduction) in the market? Are more wells expected to open elsewhere soon? If the market is volatile, with lots of wells opening and then shutting down soon after, consider waiting for a less tempestuous market before drilling.\r\n\r\n[![Image titled Drill an Oil Well Step 3](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/4d/Drill-an-Oil-Well-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/aid1441331-v4-728px-Drill-an-Oil-Well-Step-3-Version-2.jpg.webp)](https://www.wikihow.com/Drill-an-Oil-Well#/Image:Drill-an-Oil-Well-Step-3-Version-2.jpg)\r\n\r\n**3. Establish infrastructure for the drilling site.** It may be necessary to build a road to access the drilling site, or purchase boats if drilling an offshore well. Water, electricity, food, and sanitation equipment will also need to be accounted for.[&lt;sup&gt;\\[2\\]&lt;/sup&gt;](https://www.wikihow.com/Drill-an-Oil-Well#_note-2)\r\n\r\n- If drilling in a more developed urban area, infrastructure costs will be less significant.\r\n\r\n- Preparations will vary depending on the type of environment the well is being drilled in. An offshore well, for example, will require a different set of equipment than will a conventional terrestrial (land-based) oil well. Likewise, preparations for a well drilled into frozen tundra will differ from those of a well drilled in the desert.\r\n\r\n- To prepare drilling in an offshore well, a base consisting of permanent casting will need to be positioned on-site.[&lt;sup&gt;\\[3\\]&lt;/sup&gt;](https://www.wikihow.com/Drill-an-Oil-Well#_note-3) The oil company will then affix a template (a large box resembling a cookie-cutter) to the base to to provide guidance for future drills. The drilling platform itself will then be attached to the template.[&lt;sup&gt;\\[4\\]&lt;/sup&gt;](https://www.wikihow.com/Drill-an-Oil-Well#_note-4)\r\n\r\n[![Image titled Drill an Oil Well Step 4](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/11/Drill-an-Oil-Well-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/aid1441331-v4-728px-Drill-an-Oil-Well-Step-4-Version-2.jpg.webp)](https://www.wikihow.com/Drill-an-Oil-Well#/Image:Drill-an-Oil-Well-Step-4-Version-2.jpg)\r\n\r\n**4. Hire staff to assist the effort.** In addition to scientists and technical staff, drillers and maintenance personnel will be needed to oversee daily operations.\r\n\r\n- Geologists will study surface features, terrain, and rock and soil types.\r\n\r\n- Consult ecologists to ensure local wildlife will not be adversely affected.\r\n\r\n- Lawyers and company officials will help ensure all the necessary paperwork is in order.\r\n\r\n- Be sure to enlist the assistance of construction crews help prepare the site.\r\n\r\n- Hire seasoned drillers. They should be in excellent physical shape and enjoy working with machinery.[&lt;sup&gt;\\[5\\]&lt;/sup&gt;](https://www.wikihow.com/Drill-an-Oil-Well#_note-5)\r\n\r\n- A well 10,000 feet deep requires approximately 50-75 people to operate.[&lt;sup&gt;\\[6\\]&lt;/sup&gt;](https://www.wikihow.com/Drill-an-Oil-Well#_note-6)\r\n\r\n[![Image titled Drill an Oil Well Step 5](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b4/Drill-an-Oil-Well-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/aid1441331-v4-728px-Drill-an-Oil-Well-Step-5-Version-2.jpg.webp)](https://www.wikihow.com/Drill-an-Oil-Well#/Image:Drill-an-Oil-Well-Step-5-Version-2.jpg)\r\n\r\n**5. Finalize the paperwork.** Obtain any permits, lease agreements, titles, etc., needed to drill in the area. Measure any impact the drilling will have on the environment and report it to the appropriate authorities. Paperwork requirements vary by state, but some of the most common types of permits needed include:\r\n\r\n- Registration for well operation. This is the most basic declaration by a company describing their intent to drill, including where, how, and to what depth they will drill the well.\r\n\r\n- Designation of agent or operator. This form is required when a company or individual is drilling the well on behalf of another company or individual, and identifies which employees are allowed to file paperwork and make decisions regarding the drilling process.[&lt;sup&gt;\\[7\\]&lt;/sup&gt;](https://www.wikihow.com/Drill-an-Oil-Well#_note-7)\r\n\r\n- Location assessment to determine if the well will disrupt or endanger local ecosystems or aquifers.[&lt;sup&gt;\\[8\\]&lt;/sup&gt;](https://www.wikihow.com/Drill-an-Oil-Well#_note-8) [&lt;sup&gt;\\[9\\]&lt;/sup&gt;](https://www.wikihow.com/Drill-an-Oil-Well#_note-9)\r\n\r\n- Letter of credit, financial assurance statement, or performance bonds. These forms (and their accompanying fees) act like a deposit in a rental agreement, and ensure that the oil company will plug, sell, or otherwise decommission the well in accordance with local law and best practices.[&lt;sup&gt;\\[10\\]&lt;/sup&gt;](https://www.wikihow.com/Drill-an-Oil-Well#_note-10) [&lt;sup&gt;\\[11\\]&lt;/sup&gt;](https://www.wikihow.com/Drill-an-Oil-Well#_note-11)\r\n\r\n- If the well is being reopened, is changing hands, or is being altered, complete the appropriate forms will need to be completed.\r\n\r\n- Check with the governing land management agency to ensure all paperwork is filled out properly before drilling begins.\r\n\r\n[![Image titled Drill an Oil Well Step 6](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f4/Drill-an-Oil-Well-Step-6-Version-2.jpg/aid1441331-v4-728px-Drill-an-Oil-Well-Step-6-Version-2.jpg.webp)](https://www.wikihow.com/Drill-an-Oil-Well#/Image:Drill-an-Oil-Well-Step-6-Version-2.jpg)\r\n\r\n**6. Take precautions.** Mark the targeted area for drilling. Ensure all personnel are briefed on safety regulations and enforce them strictly. Once drilling is set to commence, place buoys around the area if drilling an offshore well. Use GPS coordinates to mark a designated spot when drilling on land.\r\n\r\n- Install a blowout preventer (BOP) before beginning any actual drilling. The BOP contains high-pressure safety valves which prevent oil from escaping in the event of a blowout.[&lt;sup&gt;\\[12\\]&lt;/sup&gt;](https://www.wikihow.com/Drill-an-Oil-Well#_note-12)\r\n\r\n## ADVERTISEMENTBest Savings and Checking Account Rates\r\n\r\n![](https://www.wikihow.com/images/affiliates/8/quinstreet-logo-image.png)\r\n\r\nReap the benefits of comparing multiple accounts at once.

[![Image titled Drill an Oil Well Step 7](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f8/Drill-an-Oil-Well-Step-7-Version-2.jpg/aid1441331-v4-728px-Drill-an-Oil-Well-Step-7-Version-2.jpg.webp)](https://www.wikihow.com/Drill-an-Oil-Well#/Image:Drill-an-Oil-Well-Step-7-Version-2.jpg)\r\n\r\n   **1**\r\n\r\n   **Dig in!** Before drilling the actual oil well, the interested company will have to do a lot of digging. Begin by clearing and leveling the designated area. Then dig an earthen pit (to prevent soil and water contamination), two larger holes (the &quot;rat&quot; and &quot;mouse&quot; holes) to hold piping and equipment, and a pilot hole (to guide the rest of the operation). These are essential to establishing an organized oil drilling operation.[&lt;sup&gt;\\[13\\]&lt;/sup&gt;](https://www.wikihow.com/Drill-an-Oil-Well#_note-13)\r\n\r\n   - For expanded storage space, install a &quot;cellar,&quot; a four-walled steel structure planted in the ground near the well site for the purpose of equipment storage.\r\n\r\n   - An oil company might also dig a reserve pit and line it with plastic. This pit will be used to dispose of rock cuttings and used drilling mud.[&lt;sup&gt;\\[14\\]&lt;/sup&gt;](https://www.wikihow.com/Drill-an-Oil-Well#_note-14)\r\n\r\n   - In an offshore (submerged) oil well, space for storing equipment and all infrastructure needs are built directly into the oil platform.\r\n\r\n2. [![Image titled Drill an Oil Well Step 8](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c5/Drill-an-Oil-Well-Step-8-Version-2.jpg/aid1441331-v4-728px-Drill-an-Oil-Well-Step-8-Version-2.jpg.webp)](https://www.wikihow.com/Drill-an-Oil-Well#/Image:Drill-an-Oil-Well-Step-8-Version-2.jpg)\r\n\r\n   **2**\r\n\r\n   **Assemble the oil rig.** The rig is the complex of equipment containing the drills, pumps, and other machinery needed to drill the oil well. The deeper the well, the stronger the rig will need to be. Land rigs are usually trucked in pieces to the site and then assembled, while offshore wells will have the rig integrated into the oil platform.\r\n\r\n   - Offshore oil rigs will need more stability than onshore rigs.ref\\&gt;&lt;http://www.entranceconsulting.com/2013/10/23/onshore-versus-offshore-drilling/&gt;\\&lt;/ref\\&gt;\r\n\r\n3. [![Image titled Drill an Oil Well Step 9](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c1/Drill-an-Oil-Well-Step-9-Version-2.jpg/aid1441331-v4-728px-Drill-an-Oil-Well-Step-9-Version-2.jpg.webp)](https://www.wikihow.com/Drill-an-Oil-Well#/Image:Drill-an-Oil-Well-Step-9-Version-2.jpg)\r\n\r\n   **3**\r\n\r\n   **Select a drill.** Most drills today are tricorne rotary drills. These drills feature a solid fixed cone at the bottom of the drill with three sets of steel or diamond-tipped teeth.

There are a number of ways to test for oil.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Soil gas surveys can assist in the discovery of oil. These surveys measure a soil sample for trace amounts of light hydrocarbons (the tell-tale chemical signals of oil). Soil gas surveys should be the first option when investigating whether a region contains oil because the test is relatively low-cost.<a href=\"https://www.wikihow.com/Drill-an-Oil-Well#_note-1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Seismic imaging can also help locate oil deposits.

Draft a drilling proposal.</strong> After conducting the requisite research, an oil company should consider potential complications with their drilling plan and address them in their proposal. How much money is allocated for the drilling project? How long is the well expected to be productive? What is the desired return on investment?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Ask hard questions and try to anticipate specific dates for key events -- such as the full assembly of the oil rig, commencement of oil production, and well abandonment -- over the course of the well's life.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Conduct research into the oil market. There are lots of alternatives to oil today, including solar, electric, and biofuels. Consider recent trends in the price of oil and use it determine if drilling a new oil well is a sound investment. Is there a glut (overproduction) in the market? Are more wells expected to open elsewhere soon? If the market is volatile, with lots of wells opening and then shutting down soon after, consider waiting for a less tempestuous market before drilling.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wikihow.com/Drill-an-Oil-Well#/Image:Drill-an-Oil-Well-Step-3-Version-2.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/4d/Drill-an-Oil-Well-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/aid1441331-v4-728px-Drill-an-Oil-Well-Step-3-Version-2.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Image titled Drill an Oil Well Step 3\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>3.

It\u2019s not just our history, it\u2019s the history of beer itself.\r\n\r\n## Devoted Brewers\r\n\r\n![1200s](https://www.ab-inbev.com/content/dam/abinbev/what-we-do/heritage/desktop/1200%E2%80%99s.png)![](https://www.ab-inbev.com/content/dam/abinbev/what-we-do/heritage/desktop/Church.png)![1200s](https://www.ab-inbev.com/content/dam/abinbev/what-we-do/heritage/desktop/Leffe%20logo.png)\r\n\r\nOver 800 years ago, ABI found its humble beginnings in the experienced brewing hands of Belgian monks. It was in their abbeys where one of our original beer brands, Leffe, came to be.\r\n\r\nElsewhere in Belgium, devoted monks were experimenting with brewing techniques to create Hoegaarden, a rich and citrusy wheat beer. These brews were so delicious they tempted the parishioners to skip church and instead revel in the smooth and subtle notes of the monks\u2019 labor.\r\n\r\n![](https://www.ab-inbev.com/content/dam/abinbev/what-we-do/heritage/desktop/German%20Beer%20Purity%20Law.png)Bavaria Cracks Down on Beer Brewers\r\n\r\nThe tradition of brewing wasn\u2019t exclusive to Belgians.

We\u2019re building a platform that allows us to share the latest mobile tech innovations from VR, AR, drones, IoT and more across all zones.\r\n\r\n### Tech Innovation\r\n\r\nGlobal Tech Innovation team is exploring cutting-edge technologies to help enhance our capabilities while partnering with global functional leaders and their teams across Commercial, Supply Chain, People, Sustainability, and other areas. We are looking into growing and scaling our capabilities with technologies such as AI &amp; ML, IoT, Automation &amp; Robotics, Blockchain &amp; Fintech, AR &amp; VR, Clean Tech, and others.\r\n\r\nOn the commercial front, we leverage innovative technologies that optimize our marketing and sales channels to drive topline growth and support the business of our customers. Technology is also transforming our supply chain, allowing us to distribute fresher beer in a more sustainable and efficient way while contributing to the growth of our partners and serving ever-evolving consumer needs. We are working hard to allow our employees to be the most productive, successful and authentic selves in the workplace by fueling the Dream Big mentality with helpful technology innovation spanning across all People processes (from attracting new hires to advancing throughout organization at the pace of your talent). Being an integral part of so many communities around the world, we are also proud to be exploring and developing industry-leading technologies to support a healthy natural environment and improve the livelihoods of those communities.\r\n\r\nWhat sets Beer Garage apart from other innovation Labs is our structured approach to innovation. Lean Innovation methodology, originally developed by Stanford Professor and Silicon Valley veteran Steve Blank, ensures we always start the process by listening to the customer needs and bringing the right people on board from the beginning. The culture of collaboration is extremely helpful when prioritizing key initiatives to focus on together with the business. Another principle \u2013 a learner\u2019s mindset \u2013 is widely applied and encouraged throughout all phases of corporate innovation: from defining the need, exploring the solutions, prioritizing most important ones, validating the technology through a proof of concept or MVP, piloting in a specific geography, and lastly scaling across the globe. We\u2019re always trying to remain curious and open to learn: both from our failures and successes.\r\n\r\nHere are some of the fun and interesting means of exploration driven by the Innovation team:\r\n\r\n- Tech Incubator \u2013 a unique ten-week summer internship and a talent exchange program focused on building a tech product that would address a specific global business challenge. Bringing together radically cross-functional international teams, we make sure this experience would transform not only solutions, but also team members along the way. Check out our section on the Tech Incubator and how you may get involved&#160;**[here](https://www.ab-inbev.com/what-we-do/innovation/#incubator)**.\r\n\r\n- Explore weeks&#160;\u2013 immersive exploratory missions with our functional leaders and their teams to get inspired, learn from the thought leaders in the field, and identify solutions to pilot in one of our six Zones. Beer Garage brings visibility into the pipeline of global innovation pilots while working closely with innovation teams around the world\r\n\r\n- Hack the World \u2013 our open innovation program aimed at fostering internal and external innovation eco-system globally. Our innovation teams around the world drive a wide range of engaging events throughout the year: SharkTanks to tap into creativity of our employees, Accelerators to boost the growth of local start-ups, Demo Days to engage with inventors of more mature tech solutions, Hackathons to attract new talent, and more. Check out our&#160;[YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLacb6UeghSU5tNEhUlUx2AhAHj957Wb2-)&#160;or go to&#160;[www.hack-the-world.beer](http://www.hack-the-world.beer/)&#160;to learn more\r\n\r\nWe\u2019d love to hear how your organization is driving technology innovation. If you\u2019d like to connect or share your story, you may reach us at&#160;[beergarage@abi.com]()\r\n\r\nYou might have seen some of the examples of our work in the following articles:\r\n\r\n**[Innovative keg tracking pilot](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/trackx-to-deploy-keg-tracking-solution-for-anheuserbusch-inbev-20181001-00245)  \r\n[Beer Garage brewing up exciting innovation in partnership with Microsoft Azure](https://embed.vidyard.com/share/gTyYswzwi7HJJ1ET526vUn)  \r\n[Crypto beer and digital age verification](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tobyshapshak/2018/05/15/now-you-can-buy-beer-from-an-age-verifying-blockchain-vending-machine/#3a4958c41269)  \r\n[Testing blockchain for Supply Chain efficiency and visibility](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/industry-consortium-successfully-tests-blockchain-solution-developed-by-accenture-that-could-revolutionize-ocean-shipping.htm)**\r\n\r\n### Tech Incubator\r\n\r\nIn the summer 2018, we launched our first Tech Incubator \u2013 a one of a kind internship, talent exchange and product development program. Supported by over 40 top mentors from Silicon Valley, our first cohort of teams from 5 continents set off on a mission to solve some global business challenges. What came 10 weeks later would equally surprise the team members themselves as well as our executive leadership team, present during the final Demo Day.\r\n\r\nRadically cross-functional teams composed of interns, internal tech talent and business experts, and start-ups allowed the teams to quickly and effectively dive deep and gain understanding of the true business problem they were trying to solve. Each team focused on various business areas and technologies. For example, using AI and NLP for Customer Service chatbots, applying IoT &amp; Data Analytics for smart beer packaging to gain Supply Chain visibility, or building a Procurement application leveraging Cloud and Blockchain technologies. Daily pitch trainings and mentorship provided in collaboration with our AngelHack partners ensured a constant steep learning curve for every program participant.\r\n\r\nAs a result, our interns \u2013 acting as Chief Product Officers \u2013 had a unique opportunity to drive the design and proof of concept of their solutions from beginning to end, while gaining unique insights into the ways of working at ABI and creating something new and unique with emerging technologies. Our exchange talent, both from the tech group (Solutions, in ABI terms) and the business, had a fantastic career boost, global exposure and innovation crash course all in one. We wouldn\u2019t be able to achieve the results we did without them on board. Technical experts acted as CTOs on the team, ensuring the new product would be well integrated and scalable within ABI infrastructure while business experts had a role of an SME guiding the team on internal principles, processes and ways of working. Finally, our collaborative relationships with start-ups allowed our teams to co-create and tailor their solutions to the specific use case and business need. With the scale of the largest brewer in the world, those experiences are rare and valuable for the start-ups and we\u2019re always looking forward to fostering our innovation community.\r\n\r\nDuring the Demo Day, every team participating in the program received a green light from the leadership team to proceed to pilots in one of our global locations. From India to Brazil, our Tech Incubator teams now continue to drive innovation in their geographical Zones. One of the teams even ended up submitting a provisional patent for their technology: the world\u2019s first and only platform to enable hyper-convenient autonomous selling of alcohol through age and sobriety verification. Stay tuned \u2013 we\u2019ll be sharing more on their development soon!\r\n\r\nThe internship is a door to a full-time incredible career which offers career growth, structured learning and development, senior leadership visibility and global experiences.\r\n\r\n![](https://www.ab-inbev.com/content/dam/universaltemplate/ab-inbev/what-we-do/innovation/TechIncubator.png)\r\n\r\nIf you feel excited about solving world\u2019s most pressing business and sustainability challenges through technology, join our Tech Incubator next year.

If so, what are the requirements?\\*\\*\r\n\r\nA Site Admin needs permissions to create an auth token on their Github instance. Once they have a token, they can configure the connection between their Github instance and their SOE instance.\r\n\r\n**Are there any restrictions for use?**\r\n\r\nCustomers must have a GitHub Enterprise account to leverage the integration.\r\n\r\n# **Positioning**\r\n\r\n**How are we positioning this feature?**\r\n\r\n**Value Props**\r\n\r\n- Support mission-critical teams with Stack Overflow for Team\u2019s GitHub integration by adding context to the code.\r\n\r\n- Stack Overflow for Teams\u2019 integration with GitHub enables developers to paste a link from GitHub directly in a question\r\n\r\n- Find and share information about code in GitHub right in Stack Overflow for Teams\r\n\r\n\\*\\*  \r\nUse Cases\\*\\*\r\n\r\n**Reduce workflow interruptions**\r\n\r\nBy leveraging integrations, organizations empower team members to ask questions on specific code, share answers, and source knowledge from within Stack Overflow for Teams.\r\n\r\n\\*\\*  \r\nDrive transparency\\*\\*\r\n\r\nBy encouraging teams to ask for and share information within Stack Overflow for Teams, organizations are fostering a collaborative and transparent culture. This diversity of thought within technical teams results in stronger products.\r\n\r\n\\*\\*  \r\nUnite your tools\\*\\*\r\n\r\nIn large organizations, information can be shared and stored in several places.

Today, the ORA\u2122 score has become a game changer in how multifamily companies measure and evaluate their properties\u2019 cumulative reputation across a universe of review platforms. RealPage\u2019s interest in integrating ORA\u2122 scores with their revenue management platform is a strong indication of the value these scores bring to the industry. We are very excited to take this unique data partnership forward and are confident that it will offer a new level of insight for all multifamily owners and operators,\u201d said Joseph Batdorf, President of J Turner Research.\r\n\r\nThe number of online apartment reviews has grown more than&#160;**three and a half times**&#160;over the past five years, from 2.7 million total reviews in 2015 to nearly 10.4 million as of Q3 2020\u2014underscoring the degree to which consumers increasingly create and consult reviews as the primary means of judging the quality of a product or service.\r\n\r\n\u201cA property\u2019s online reputation is indicative of its ability to attract prospects and retain residents, and those properties with higher ORA\u2122 scores have a lead conversion rate of 4 points better than those with low ORA\u2122 scores, based on a recent case study,\u201d Batdorf adds.\r\n\r\n**About RealPage**\\\r\nRealPage provides a technology platform that enables real estate owners and managers to change how people experience and use rental space.

You can earn a maximum of 200 reputation per day from the combination of upvotes and downvotes. Bounties and accepted answers are not subject to this daily reputation limit.\r\n\r\n### Lose reputation\r\n\r\n**You lose reputation when:**\r\n\r\n\\-2 Your question is voted down.\r\n\r\n\\-2 Your answer is voted down.\r\n\r\n\\-1 You vote down an answer.\r\n\r\n(Varies) You place a [bounty](https://www.stackoverflow.help/support/solutions/articles/36000190374-bounties) on a question.\r\n\r\nDeleted posts do not affect reputation for voters, authors, or anyone else involved, in most cases. If a user reverses a vote, the corresponding reputation loss or gain will be reversed as well.\r\n\r\n### Privileges\r\n\r\nMost privileges on Teams do not require any reputation at all and are available to all users as soon as they gain access. The following privileges are restricted by reputation thresholds. You gain access to them the moment you meet the reputation requirement, and also lose access to them if you drop below the threshold.\r\n\r\nCast down votes at 125 reputation",

Likewise, search the body only (exclude the title) with&#160;`body:&quot;phrase here&quot;`.\r\n\r\n* To search only within code blocks:&#160;`code:&quot;new&quot;`&#160;to search code within posts for the word &quot;new&quot;.\r\n\r\n* To search&#160;*just your*&#160;posts:&#160;`user:me training`&#160;searches all of your posts for the word &quot;training&quot;.\r\n\r\n* To&#160;*exclude*&#160;results from a tag, term or phrase, prefix it with&#160;`-`&#160;in your query:&#160;`waffles -unicorns`&#160;finds posts that mention tasty batter-based breakfasts without including mythical creatures, while&#160;`[laurel] -[hardy]`&#160;includes only posts pertaining to the first half of the classic comedy couple.\r\n\r\n* Use wildcard searches to broaden results; add an asterisk (`*`) anywhere in the word, like&#160;`encour*`&#160;or&#160;`Ex*nge`.\r\n\r\n## Advanced Search Options:\r\n\r\nWe offer a number of advanced search operators to help you find very specific information.\r\n\r\n### Range Operators\r\n\r\nTo search for only questions that fall within a particular range for&#160;**score**, number of&#160;**answers**, or number of&#160;**views**, you can enter an upper or lower parameter, or a range.\r\n\r\n* `score:-1`&#160;or&#160;`score:-1..`&#160;will both return posts with a score greater than or equal to -1\r\n\r\n* `views:500..1000`&#160;or&#160;`views:500-1000`&#160;will return posts with 500 to 1000 views\r\n\r\n* `answers:..3`&#160;will return questions with 3 or fewer answers\r\n\r\n### Dates\r\n\r\nYou can use specific dates or date ranges to narrow results down to posts created or active within a certain time period, using the following operators:\r\n\r\n* `created:`&#160;to specify when the posts were created\r\n\r\n* `lastactive:`&#160;for posts active in a specified time period\r\n\r\nDates can be entered in the following formats:\r\n\r\n* Absolute dates:\r\n\r\n  * *year only*&#160;\u2013 e.g.,&#160;`created:2012..2013`&#160;searches posts created from January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2013;&#160;`created:2012`&#160;searches posts created from January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012.\r\n\r\n  * *year and month*&#160;\u2013 e.g.,&#160;`created:2012-04..2012-05`&#160;searches posts created between April 1, 2012 and May 31, 2012.\r\n\r\n  * *day, month, and year*&#160;\u2013 e.g.,&#160;`lastactive:2012-04-03`&#160;searches posts who were last active between 12:00 AM on April 3, 2012 and 11:59 PM on April 3, 2012.\r\n\r\n* Relative dates:\r\n\r\n  * `1y`,&#160;`1m`, and&#160;`1d`&#160;are shorthand for &quot;last year&quot;, &quot;last month&quot;, and &quot;yesterday&quot; - e.g., if today is April 15,&#160;`created:1m`&#160;searches posts created between March 1 and March 31. (You can substitute any number for&#160;`1`&#160;to look back that many years, months, or days.)\r\n\r\n  * Relative dates in a range (`1y..`) look back to the same date in the previous period - e.g., if you want to see all the posts active in the last three months, use&#160;`lastactive:3m..`&#160;On April 15, that will show posts from January 15 up to the most recently active. You can close the range as well:&#160;`lastactive:3m..1m`.\r\n\r\n**Please note**&#160;that all times are recorded in UTC; the results may not match your timezone.\r\n\r\n### User Operators\r\n\r\nYou can also limit searches to a specific user&#39;s content (your own or someone else&#39;s). You will need the user id to search another user&#39;s posts.\r\n\r\n* `user:mine`&#160;or&#160;`user:me`&#160;(or any user id) returns only your posts (or only the posts from whichever user whose id you entered)\r\n\r\n* `inbookmarks:mine`&#160;(or any user id) returns only questions that you (or the user whose id you entered) have bookmarked.\r\n\r\n* `intags:mine`&#160;returns only posts that appear in tags you have marked as favorite. (If you don&#39;t have any tags, this operator does nothing. For better results, update your preferences.)\r\n\r\n### Boolean Operators\r\n\r\nThe following search operators can be used with values of yes/no, true/false, or 1/0 (each pair behaves the same):\r\n\r\n* `isaccepted:`&#160;yes/true/1 returns only&#160;**answers**&#160;that have been marked &quot;accepted&quot;; no/false/0 returns only answers that are not marked accepted.\r\n\r\n* `hascode:`&#160;yes/true/1 returns only posts that contain code blocks; no/false/0 returns only posts that contain&#160;*no*&#160;code.\r\n\r\n* `hasaccepted:`&#160;yes/true/1 returns only&#160;**questions**&#160;that have accepted answers; no/false/0 returns only questions with no accepted answers.\r\n\r\n* `isanswered:`&#160;yes/true/1 returns only questions that have at least one positively-scored answer; no/false/0 returns only questions with no positively-scored answers.\r\n\r\n* `closed:`&#160;yes/true/1 returns only questions that are closed; no/false/0 excludes closed questions from the search.\r\n\r\n* `duplicate:`&#160;yes/true/1 returns questions that have been marked as a duplicate of another question; no/false/0 excludes duplicate questions from the search.\r\n\r\n* `migrated:`&#160;yes/true/1 returns only questions that have been migrated to a different site; no/false/0 excludes migrated questions from the search.\r\n\r\n* `locked:`&#160;yes/true/1 returns only locked posts (which have edits, votes, comments, and new answers disabled); no/false/0 returns only posts that are not locked.\r\n\r\n* `hasnotice:`&#160;yes/true/1 returns only posts with a notice shown below them; no/false/0 returns only posts that do not have a notice applied.\r\n\r\n* `wiki:`&#160;yes/true/1 returns only&#160;[community wiki](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/11740/what-are-community-wiki-posts)&#160;posts; no/false/0 returns only non-community wiki posts.\r\n\r\n### OR operator\r\n\r\nTo combine results from multiple tags, separate the tag names (enclosed in square brackets) with the word &quot;or&quot;:&#160;`[widgets] or [geegaws]`&#160;returns questions tagged with&#160;*either*&#160;tag.\r\n\r\n### Miscellaneous Operators\r\n\r\n* `url:&quot;example.com&quot;`&#160;searches for posts containing the url &quot;example.com&quot;\r\n\r\n* `is:question`&#160;narrows results down to just questions, and&#160;`is:answer`&#160;returns only answers\r\n\r\n* `inquestion:50691`&#160;restricts the search to the question with id 50691. If you are searching using the search box on a question page, you can use&#160;`inquestion:this`&#160;to restrict results to the post you are already viewing.\r\n\r\n### Deleted Posts (requires 10,000 reputation)\r\n\r\nWhen you earn&#160;[the Access to Moderator Tools](https://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges/moderator-tools)&#160;privilege, you may search your own deleted posts by using the&#160;`deleted:`&#160;operator.\r\n\r\n* `deleted:1`&#160;searches only your deleted posts\r\n\r\n* `deleted:all`&#160;searches both deleted and not-deleted posts that you&#39;ve authored\r\n\r\n* `deleted:0`&#160;searches only not-deleted posts that you&#39;ve authored (effectively the same as&#160;`user:me`)\r\n\r\n[Site Moderators](https://stackoverflow.com/help/site-moderators)&#160;may use this operator to search&#160;*all*&#160;posts on the site, including those owned by other users.",
