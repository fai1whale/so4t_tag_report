[Machine learning algorithms](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/machine-learning-algorithms/) are able to detect patterns in data and learn from them, in order to make their own predictions. In short, machine learning algorithms and models learn through experience.\r\n\r\nIn traditional programming, a computer engineer writes a series of directions that instruct a computer how to transform input data into a desired output. Instructions are mostly based on an IF-THEN structure: when certain conditions are met, the program executes a specific action.\r\n\r\nMachine learning, on the other hand, is an automated process that enables machines to solve problems with little or no human input, and take actions based on past observations.\r\n\r\nWhile [artificial intelligence and machine learning](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/nlp-ai/) are often used interchangeably, they are two different concepts. AI is the broader concept \u2013 machines making decisions, learning new skills, and solving problems in a similar way to humans \u2013 whereas machine learning is a subset of AI that enables intelligent systems to autonomously learn new things from data.\r\n\r\nInstead of programming machine learning algorithms to perform tasks, you can feed them examples of labeled data (known as [training data](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/training-data/)), which helps them make calculations, process data, and identify patterns automatically.\r\n\r\nPut simply, Google\u2019s Chief Decision Scientist describes machine learning as [a fancy labeling machine](https://hackernoon.com/six-useful-metaphors-for-thinking-about-artificial-intelligence-c7468b1551fa). After teaching machines to label things like apples and pears, by showing them examples of fruit, eventually they will start labeling apples and pears without any help \u2013 provided they have learned from appropriate and accurate training examples.\r\n\r\nMachine learning can be put to work on massive amounts of data and can perform much more accurately than humans. It can help you save time and money on tasks and analyses, like [solving customer pain points](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/customer-pain-points/) to improve customer satisfaction, [support ticket automation](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/ticket-classification-with-ai/), and [data mining](https://monkeylearn.com/text-mining/) from internal sources and all over the internet.\r\n\r\nBut what\u2019s behind the machine learning process?\r\n\r\n## Types of Machine Learning\r\n\r\n![](data:image/png;base64,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)![Types of machine learning](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/bf53082cd74ce4289ea9e633d52a86ac226bb467/9f692/static/00d97fa74ccf3ae99e95febc7b85f11c/e4918/types.jpg)\r\n\r\nTo understand how machine learning works, you\u2019ll need to explore different machine learning methods and algorithms, which are basically sets of rules that machines use to make decisions. Below, you\u2019ll find the five most common and most used types of machine learning:\r\n\r\n### Supervised Learning\r\n\r\n[Supervised learning algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning) and supervised learning models make predictions based on labeled training data. Each training sample includes an input and a desired output. A supervised learning algorithm analyzes this sample data and makes an inference \u2013 basically, an educated guess when determining the labels for unseen data.\r\n\r\nThis is the most common and popular approach to machine learning. It\u2019s \u201csupervised\u201d because these models need to be fed manually tagged sample data to learn from. Data is labeled to tell the machine what patterns (similar words and images, data categories, etc.) it should be looking for and recognize connections with.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you want to automatically detect spam, you would need to feed a machine learning algorithm examples of emails that you want classified as spam and others that are important, and should not be considered spam.\r\n\r\nWhich brings us to our next point \u2013 the two types of supervised learning tasks: *classification* and *regression*.\r\n\r\n#### Classification in supervised machine learning\r\n\r\nThere are a number of [classification algorithms](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/classification-algorithms/) used in supervised learning, with [Support Vector Machines (SVM)](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/introduction-to-support-vector-machines-svm/) and [Naive Bayes](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/practical-explanation-naive-bayes-classifier/) among the most common.\r\n\r\nIn classification tasks, the output value is a category with a finite number of options. For example, with this [free pre-trained sentiment analysis model](https://monkeylearn.com/sentiment-analysis-online/), you can automatically classify data as positive, negative, or neutral.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s say you want to analyze customer support conversations to understand your clients\u2019 emotions: are they happy or frustrated after contacting your customer service team? A [sentiment analysis](https://monkeylearn.com/sentiment-analysis/) classifier can automatically tag responses for you, like in the below:\r\n\r\n### Test with your own text\r\n\r\nClassify Text\r\n\r\n### Results\r\n\r\nTAGCONFIDENCE\r\n\r\nNegative99.7%\r\n\r\nIn this example, a sentiment analysis model tags a frustrating customer support experience as *\u201cNegative\u201d*.\r\n\r\n#### Regression in supervised machine learning\r\n\r\nIn regression tasks, the expected result is a continuous number. This model is used to predict quantities, such as the probability an event will happen, meaning the output may have any number value within a certain range. Predicting the value of a property in a specific neighborhood or the spread of COVID19 in a particular region are examples of regression problems.\r\n\r\n### Unsupervised Learning\r\n\r\n[Unsupervised learning algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning) uncover insights and relationships in unlabeled data. In this case, models are fed input data but the desired outcomes are unknown, so they have to make inferences based on circumstantial evidence, without any guidance or training. The models are not trained with the \u201cright answer,\u201d so they must find patterns on their own.\r\n\r\nOne of the most common types of unsupervised learning is clustering, which consists of grouping similar data. This method is mostly used for exploratory analysis and can help you detect hidden patterns or trends.\r\n\r\nFor example, the marketing team of an e-commerce company could [use clustering to improve customer segmentation](https://bdtechtalks.com/2020/12/28/machine-learning-customer-segmentation/). Given a set of income and spending data, a machine learning model can identify groups of customers with similar behaviors.\r\n\r\nSegmentation allows marketers to tailor strategies for each key market. They might offer promotions and discounts for low-income customers that are high spenders on the site, as a way to reward loyalty and improve retention.\r\n\r\n### Semi-Supervised Learning\r\n\r\nIn [semi-supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-supervised_learning), training data is split into two. A small amount of labeled data and a larger set of unlabeled data.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the model uses labeled data as an input to make inferences about the unlabeled data, providing more accurate results than regular supervised-learning models.\r\n\r\nThis approach is gaining popularity, especially for tasks involving large datasets such as image classification. Semi-supervised learning doesn\u2019t require a large number of labeled data, so it\u2019s faster to set up, more cost-effective than supervised learning methods, and ideal for businesses that receive huge amounts of data.\r\n\r\n### Reinforcement Learning\r\n\r\n[Reinforcement learning (RL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) is concerned with how a software agent (or computer program) ought to act in a situation to maximize the reward. In short, reinforced machine learning models attempt to determine the best possible path they should take in a given situation. They do this through trial and error. Since there is no training data, machines learn from their own mistakes and choose the actions that lead to the best solution or maximum reward.\r\n\r\nThis machine learning method is mostly used in robotics and gaming. Video games demonstrate a clear relationship between actions and results, and can measure success by keeping score. Therefore, they\u2019re a great way to improve reinforcement learning algorithms.\r\n\r\n### Deep Learning (DL)\r\n\r\n[Deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) models can be supervised, semi-supervised, or unsupervised (or a combination of any or all of the three). They\u2019re advanced machine learning algorithms used by tech giants, like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon to run entire systems and power things, like self driving cars and smart assistants.\r\n\r\n![](data:image/png;base64,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)![A diagram showing the progression from Artificial Intelligence, to Machine Learning, to Deep Learning from the 1950s to modern day.](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/63553ee725acd0218379770d399a64bbaea83109/a3971/static/83ef48b5cf3020a618d878835a6d2167/41b2a/image12.png)\r\n\r\nDeep learning is based on [Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network), a type of computer system that emulates the way the human brain works. Deep learning algorithms or neural networks are built with multiple layers of interconnected neurons, allowing multiple systems to work together simultaneously, and step-by-step.\r\n\r\nWhen a model receives input data \u2012 which could be image, text, video, or audio \u2012 and is asked to perform a task (for example, [text classification with machine learning](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/text-classification-machine-learning/)), the data passes through every layer, enabling the model to learn progressively. It\u2019s kind of like a human brain that evolves with age and experience!\r\n\r\nDeep learning is common in image recognition, speech recognition, and [Natural Language Processing (NLP)](https://monkeylearn.com/natural-language-processing/). Deep learning models usually perform better than other machine learning algorithms for complex problems and massive sets of data. However, they generally require millions upon millions of pieces of training data, so it takes quite a lot of time to train them.\r\n\r\n## How Machine Learning Works\r\n\r\n![](data:image/png;base64,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)![How it Works](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7924a51c181551cf9a9b32c34f9ffd5c9c72d509/cfc45/static/1f82dcd2399e05c4e7aa9b7f9c1aac69/e4918/how-it-works.jpg)\r\n\r\nIn order to understand how machine learning works, first you need to know what a \u201ctag\u201d is. To train image recognition, for example, you would \u201ctag\u201d photos of dogs, cats, horses, etc., with the appropriate animal name.

If you\u2019re working with sentiment analysis, you would feed the model with [customer feedback](https://monkeylearn.com/customer-feedback/), for example, and train the model by tagging each comment as Positive, Neutral, and Negative.\r\n\r\nTake a look at the diagram below:\r\n\r\n![](data:image/png;base64,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)![A diagram showing how training a machine learning text analysis model works.](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/426ec3f7d3a414adecc2890677d79c4ae14be795/59e63/static/74491b164c59b243e5f6d601c0365fbf/ebbb8/ml-process.png)\r\n\r\nAt its most simplistic, the machine learning process involves three steps:\r\n\r\n1. Feed a machine learning model training input data. In our case, this could be customer comments from social media or customer service data.\r\n\r\n2. Tag training data with a desired output. In this case, tell your sentiment analysis model whether each comment or piece of data is *Positive, Neutral,* or *Negative*. The model transforms the training data into [text vectors](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/beginners-guide-text-vectorization/) \u2013 numbers that represent data features.\r\n\r\n3. Test your model by feeding it testing (or unseen) data. Algorithms are trained to associate feature vectors with tags based on manually tagged samples, then learn to make predictions when processing unseen data.\r\n\r\nIf your new model performs to your standards and criteria after testing it, it\u2019s ready to be put to work on all kinds of new data. If it\u2019s not performing accurately, you\u2019ll need to keep training. Furthermore, as human language and industry-specific language morphs and changes, you may need to continually train your model with new information.\r\n\r\n## Machine Learning Use Cases\r\n\r\n![](data:image/png;base64,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)![Applications](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f439bef1209d3166831f31558e5b8569450de32a/579e8/static/45045437eb6f2392b12d432a90644875/e4918/machine-learning-applications.jpg)\r\n\r\n[Machine learning applications](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/machine-learning-applications/) and use cases are nearly endless, especially as we begin to work from home more (or have [hybrid offices](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-15/boe-says-work-after-covid-will-be-done-both-in-home-and-offices)), become more tied to our smartphones, and use machine learning-guided technology to get around.\r\n\r\n[Machine learning in finance](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/machine-learning-in-finance/), healthcare, hospitality, government, and beyond, is already in regular use. Businesses are beginning to see the benefits of using machine learning tools to improve their processes, gain valuable insights from [unstructured data](https://monkeylearn.com/unstructured-data/), and automate tasks that would otherwise require hours of tedious, manual work (which usually produces much less accurate results).\r\n\r\nFor example, [UberEats uses machine learning](https://thenewstack.io/how-uber-eats-uses-machine-learning-to-estimate-delivery-times/) to estimate optimum times for drivers to pick up food orders, while [Spotify leverages machine learning to offer personalized content](https://labs.spotify.com/2020/01/16/for-your-ears-only-personalizing-spotify-home-with-machine-learning/) and [personalized marketing](https://blog.snappymob.com/spotify-wrapped-personalized-marketing-done-right). And [Dell uses machine learning text analysis](https://monkeylearn.com/customers/dell) to save hundreds of hours analyzing thousands of employee surveys to listen to the [voice of employee (VoE)](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/voice-of-employee/) and improve employee satisfaction.\r\n\r\nHow do you think [Google Maps predicts peaks in traffic](https://www.cnet.com/news/heres-how-google-maps-uses-ai-to-predict-traffic-and-calculate-routes/) and Netflix creates personalized movie recommendations, [even informs the creation of new content](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/shannonkeating/ginny-georgia-netflix-season-1-review) ? By using machine learning, of course.\r\n\r\nThere are many different applications of machine learning, which can benefit your business in countless ways. You\u2019ll just need to define a strategy to help you decide the best way to implement machine learning into your existing processes. In the meantime, here are some common machine learning use cases and applications that might spark some ideas:\r\n\r\n- Social Media Monitoring\r\n\r\n- Customer Service &amp; Customer Satisfaction\r\n\r\n- Image Recognition\r\n\r\n- Virtual Assistants\r\n\r\n- Product Recommendations\r\n\r\n- Stock Market Trading\r\n\r\n- Medical Diagnosis\r\n\r\n### Social Media Monitoring\r\n\r\n[Using machine learning you can monitor mentions of your brand on social media](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/analyzing-customer-support-interactions-on-twitter-with-machine-learning/) and immediately identify if customers require urgent attention. By detecting mentions from angry customers, in real-time, you can [automatically tag customer feedback](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/auto-tagging-customer-feedback-with-machine-learning/) and respond right away. You might also want to analyze customer support interactions on social media and gauge [customer satisfaction (CSAT)](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/csat-calculation/), to see how well your team is performing.\r\n\r\n[Natural Language Processing](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/nlp-python/) gives machines the ability to break down spoken or written language much like a human would, to process \u201cnatural\u201d language, so machine learning can handle text from practically any source.\r\n\r\n### Customer Service &amp; Customer Satisfaction\r\n\r\nMachine learning allows you to [integrate powerful text analysis tools with customer support tools](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/zendesk-machine-learning/), so you can analyze your emails, live chats, and all manner of internal data on the go. You can use machine learning to tag support tickets and route them to the correct teams or auto-respond to common queries so you never leave a customer in the cold.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, using machine learning to set up a [voice of customer (VoC) program](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/voice-of-customer-program/) and a [customer feedback loop](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/customer-feedback-loop/) will ensure that you follow the customer journey from start to finish to improve the customer experience (CX), [decrease customer churn](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/customer-churn-analysis/), and, ultimately, increase your profits.\r\n\r\n### Image Recognition\r\n\r\nImage recognition is helping companies identify and classify images. For example, [facial recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_recognition_system) technology is being used as a form of identification, from unlocking phones to [making payments](https://news.yahoo.com/facial-recognition-payments-rolled-russia-132117843.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALNtRv5uWrd8hRSE60AldUxuED2Q1gKcmO9_NUdcKLJvuPAX23STUavdKYLR7cKIydB89adb_9Lm9eiU5XjF1h63QPbD35zJKbn8bfd9yhTg3pjlZyubtDD4ivh7vGNhRCleToUEEf69rAiRAYzjKbrklfxy6jWQcs5KyHqQnPVk).\r\n\r\nSelf-driving cars also use image recognition to perceive space and obstacles. For example, they can learn to recognize stop signs, identify intersections, and make decisions based on what they see.\r\n\r\n### Virtual Assistants\r\n\r\nVirtual assistants, like Siri, Alexa, Google Now, all make use of machine learning to automatically process and answer voice requests. They quickly scan information, remember related queries, learn from previous interactions, and send commands to other apps, so they can collect information and deliver the most effective answer.\r\n\r\nCustomer support teams are already using virtual assistants to handle phone calls, [automatically route support tickets](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/automatically-route-customer-support-tickets-to-the-most-appropriate-person/), to the correct teams, and speed up interactions with customers via computer-generated responses.\r\n\r\n### Product Recommendations\r\n\r\n[Association rule-learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_rule_learning) is a machine learning technique that can be used to analyze purchasing habits at the supermarket or on e-commerce sites. It works by searching for relationships between variables and finding common associations in transactions (products that consumers usually buy together). This data is then used for product placement strategies and similar product recommendations.\r\n\r\nAssociated rules can also be useful to plan a marketing campaign or analyze web usage.\r\n\r\n### Stock Market Trading\r\n\r\nMachine learning algorithms can be trained to identify trading opportunities, by recognizing patterns and behaviors in historical data. Humans are often driven by emotions when it comes to making investments, so [sentiment analysis with machine learning](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/sentiment-analysis-machine-learning/) can play a huge role in identifying good and bad investing opportunities, with no human bias, whatsoever. They can even save time and [allow traders more time away from their screens by automating tasks](https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/20028/how-is-ai-revolutionizing-fx-market-in-a-way-we-didnt-even-realize).\r\n\r\n### Medical Diagnosis\r\n\r\nThe ability of machines to find patterns in complex data is shaping the present and future. Take [machine learning initiatives during the COVID-19 outbreak](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/348368), for instance. AI tools have helped predict how the virus will spread over time, and shaped how we control it. It\u2019s also helped diagnose patients by analyzing lung CTs and detecting fevers using facial recognition, and identified patients at a higher risk of developing serious respiratory disease.\r\n\r\nMachine learning is driving innovation in many fields, and every day we\u2019re seeing new interesting use cases emerge. In business, the overall benefits of machine learning include:\r\n\r\n- **It\u2019s cost-effective and scalable.** You only need to train a machine learning model once, and you can scale up or down depending on how much data you receive.\r\n\r\n- **Performs more accurately than humans.** Machine learning models are trained with a certain amount of labeled data and will use it to make predictions on unseen data. Based on this data, machines define a set of rules that they apply to all datasets, helping them provide consistent and accurate results. No need to worry about human error or innate bias. And you can train the tools to the needs and criteria of your business.\r\n\r\n- **Works in real-time, 24/7.** Machine learning models can automatically analyze data in real-time, allowing you to immediately detect negative opinions or urgent tickets and take action.\r\n\r\n## Get Started With Machine Learning Tools\r\n\r\n![](data:image/png;base64,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)![How to Get Started](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/dbf56c77075ae541268fb144e637253a6e30c8cd/24f84/static/d991f222f3d3be2ac3fbad7277e9a0ad/e4918/tools.jpg)\r\n\r\nWhen you\u2019re ready to get started with machine learning tools it comes down to the [Build vs. Buy Debate](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/build-vs-buy/). If you have a data science and computer engineering background or are prepared to hire whole teams of coders and computer scientists, building your own with open-source libraries can produce great results. Building your own tools, however, can take months or years and cost in the tens of thousands.\r\n\r\nUsing SaaS or [MLaaS (Machine Learning as a Service)](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/mlaas/) tools, on the other hand, is much cheaper because you only pay what you use.

In short, machine learning algorithms and models learn through experience.</p>\n<p>In traditional programming, a computer engineer writes a series of directions that instruct a computer how to transform input data into a desired output. Instructions are mostly based on an IF-THEN structure: when certain conditions are met, the program executes a specific action.</p>\n<p>Machine learning, on the other hand, is an automated process that enables machines to solve problems with little or no human input, and take actions based on past observations.</p>\n<p>While <a href=\"https://monkeylearn.com/blog/nlp-ai/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">artificial intelligence and machine learning</a> are often used interchangeably, they are two different concepts. AI is the broader concept \u2013 machines making decisions, learning new skills, and solving problems in a similar way to humans \u2013 whereas machine learning is a subset of AI that enables intelligent systems to autonomously learn new things from data.</p>\n<p>Instead of programming machine learning algorithms to perform tasks, you can feed them examples of labeled data (known as <a href=\"https://monkeylearn.com/blog/training-data/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">training data</a>), which helps them make calculations, process data, and identify patterns automatically.</p>\n<p>Put simply, Google\u2019s Chief Decision Scientist describes machine learning as <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/six-useful-metaphors-for-thinking-about-artificial-intelligence-c7468b1551fa\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a fancy labeling machine</a>. After teaching machines to label things like apples and pears, by showing them examples of fruit, eventually they will start labeling apples and pears without any help \u2013 provided they have learned from appropriate and accurate training examples.</p>\n<p>Machine learning can be put to work on massive amounts of data and can perform much more accurately than humans. It can help you save time and money on tasks and analyses, like <a href=\"https://monkeylearn.com/blog/customer-pain-points/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">solving customer pain points</a> to improve customer satisfaction, <a href=\"https://monkeylearn.com/blog/ticket-classification-with-ai/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">support ticket automation</a>, and <a href=\"https://monkeylearn.com/text-mining/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">data mining</a> from internal sources and all over the internet.</p>\n<p>But what\u2019s behind the machine learning process?</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-types-of-machine-learning\">Types of Machine Learning</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/bf53082cd74ce4289ea9e633d52a86ac226bb467/9f692/static/00d97fa74ccf3ae99e95febc7b85f11c/e4918/types.jpg\" alt=\"Types of machine learning\"></p>\n<p>To understand how machine learning works, you\u2019ll need to explore different machine learning methods and algorithms, which are basically sets of rules that machines use to make decisions. Below, you\u2019ll find the five most common and most used types of machine learning:</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-supervised-learning\">Supervised Learning</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Supervised learning algorithms</a> and supervised learning models make predictions based on labeled training data. Each training sample includes an input and a desired output. A supervised learning algorithm analyzes this sample data and makes an inference \u2013 basically, an educated guess when determining the labels for unseen data.</p>\n<p>This is the most common and popular approach to machine learning. It\u2019s \u201csupervised\u201d because these models need to be fed manually tagged sample data to learn from. Data is labeled to tell the machine what patterns (similar words and images, data categories, etc.) it should be looking for and recognize connections with.</p>\n<p>For example, if you want to automatically detect spam, you would need to feed a machine learning algorithm examples of emails that you want classified as spam and others that are important, and should not be considered spam.</p>\n<p>Which brings us to our next point \u2013 the two types of supervised learning tasks: <em>classification</em> and <em>regression</em>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"heading-classification-in-supervised-machine-learning\">Classification in supervised machine learning</h4>\n<p>There are a number of <a href=\"https://monkeylearn.com/blog/classification-algorithms/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">classification algorithms</a> used in supervised learning, with <a href=\"https://monkeylearn.com/blog/introduction-to-support-vector-machines-svm/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Support Vector Machines (SVM)</a> and <a href=\"https://monkeylearn.com/blog/practical-explanation-naive-bayes-classifier/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Naive Bayes</a> among the most common.</p>\n<p>In classification tasks, the output value is a category with a finite number of options. For example, with this <a href=\"https://monkeylearn.com/sentiment-analysis-online/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">free pre-trained sentiment analysis model</a>, you can automatically classify data as positive, negative, or neutral.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you want to analyze customer support conversations to understand your clients\u2019 emotions: are they happy or frustrated after contacting your customer service team? A <a href=\"https://monkeylearn.com/sentiment-analysis/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">sentiment analysis</a> classifier can automatically tag responses for you, like in the below:</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-test-with-your-own-text\">Test with your own text</h3>\n<p>Classify Text</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-results\">Results</h3>\n<p>TAGCONFIDENCE</p>\n<p>Negative99.7%</p>\n<p>In this example, a sentiment analysis model tags a frustrating customer support experience as <em>\u201cNegative\u201d</em>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"heading-regression-in-supervised-machine-learning\">Regression in supervised machine learning</h4>\n<p>In regression tasks, the expected result is a continuous number. This model is used to predict quantities, such as the probability an event will happen, meaning the output may have any number value within a certain range. Predicting the value of a property in a specific neighborhood or the spread of COVID19 in a particular region are examples of regression problems.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-unsupervised-learning\">Unsupervised Learning</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Unsupervised learning algorithms</a> uncover insights and relationships in unlabeled data. In this case, models are fed input data but the desired outcomes are unknown, so they have to make inferences based on circumstantial evidence, without any guidance or training. The models are not trained with the \u201cright answer,\u201d so they must find patterns on their own.</p>\n<p>One of the most common types of unsupervised learning is clustering, which consists of grouping similar data. This method is mostly used for exploratory analysis and can help you detect hidden patterns or trends.</p>\n<p>For example, the marketing team of an e-commerce company could <a href=\"https://bdtechtalks.com/2020/12/28/machine-learning-customer-segmentation/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">use clustering to improve customer segmentation</a>. Given a set of income and spending data, a machine learning model can identify groups of customers with similar behaviors.</p>\n<p>Segmentation allows marketers to tailor strategies for each key market. They might offer promotions and discounts for low-income customers that are high spenders on the site, as a way to reward loyalty and improve retention.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-semi-supervised-learning\">Semi-Supervised Learning</h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-supervised_learning\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">semi-supervised learning</a>, training data is split into two. A small amount of labeled data and a larger set of unlabeled data.</p>\n<p>In this case, the model uses labeled data as an input to make inferences about the unlabeled data, providing more accurate results than regular supervised-learning models.</p>\n<p>This approach is gaining popularity, especially for tasks involving large datasets such as image classification. Semi-supervised learning doesn\u2019t require a large number of labeled data, so it\u2019s faster to set up, more cost-effective than supervised learning methods, and ideal for businesses that receive huge amounts of data.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-reinforcement-learning\">Reinforcement Learning</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Reinforcement learning (RL)</a> is concerned with how a software agent (or computer program) ought to act in a situation to maximize the reward. In short, reinforced machine learning models attempt to determine the best possible path they should take in a given situation. They do this through trial and error. Since there is no training data, machines learn from their own mistakes and choose the actions that lead to the best solution or maximum reward.</p>\n<p>This machine learning method is mostly used in robotics and gaming. Video games demonstrate a clear relationship between actions and results, and can measure success by keeping score. Therefore, they\u2019re a great way to improve reinforcement learning algorithms.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-deep-learning-dl\">Deep Learning (DL)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deep learning</a> models can be supervised, semi-supervised, or unsupervised (or a combination of any or all of the three). They\u2019re advanced machine learning algorithms used by tech giants, like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon to run entire systems and power things, like self driving cars and smart assistants.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/63553ee725acd0218379770d399a64bbaea83109/a3971/static/83ef48b5cf3020a618d878835a6d2167/41b2a/image12.png\" alt=\"A diagram showing the progression from Artificial Intelligence, to Machine Learning, to Deep Learning from the 1950s to modern day.\"></p>\n<p>Deep learning is based on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)</a>, a type of computer system that emulates the way the human brain works. Deep learning algorithms or neural networks are built with multiple layers of interconnected neurons, allowing multiple systems to work together simultaneously, and step-by-step.</p>\n<p>When a model receives input data \u2012 which could be image, text, video, or audio \u2012 and is asked to perform a task (for example, <a href=\"https://monkeylearn.com/blog/text-classification-machine-learning/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">text classification with machine learning</a>), the data passes through every layer, enabling the model to learn progressively. It\u2019s kind of like a human brain that evolves with age and experience!</p>\n<p>Deep learning is common in image recognition, speech recognition, and <a href=\"https://monkeylearn.com/natural-language-processing/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Natural Language Processing (NLP)</a>. Deep learning models usually perform better than other machine learning algorithms for complex problems and massive sets of data. However, they generally require millions upon millions of pieces of training data, so it takes quite a lot of time to train them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-how-machine-learning-works\">How Machine Learning Works</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7924a51c181551cf9a9b32c34f9ffd5c9c72d509/cfc45/static/1f82dcd2399e05c4e7aa9b7f9c1aac69/e4918/how-it-works.jpg\" alt=\"How it Works\"></p>\n<p>In order to understand how machine learning works, first you need to know what a \u201ctag\u201d is. To train image recognition, for example, you would \u201ctag\u201d photos of dogs, cats, horses, etc., with the appropriate animal name. This is also called <a href=\"https://monkeylearn.com/blog/data-labeling/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">data labeling</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/aca9a68541d9454c63f3a57a20bd22d643d3cc6e/8fe3f/static/24daa8033dc87608b8544bb20b247ddb/95da0/image-classification.png\" alt=\"Showing how a kitten image is labeled, so a machine learning model can recognize other kitten images and label them correctly.\"></p>\n<p>When working with <a href=\"https://monkeylearn.com/text-analysis/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">machine learning text analysis</a>, you would feed a text analysis model with text training data, then tag it, depending on what kind of analysis you\u2019re doing. If you\u2019re working with sentiment analysis, you would feed the model with <a href=\"https://monkeylearn.com/customer-feedback/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">customer feedback</a>, for example, and train the model by tagging each comment as Positive, Neutral, and Negative.</p>\n<p>Take a look at the diagram below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/426ec3f7d3a414adecc2890677d79c4ae14be795/59e63/static/74491b164c59b243e5f6d601c0365fbf/ebbb8/ml-process.png\" alt=\"A diagram showing how training a machine learning text analysis model works.\"></p>\n<p>At its most simplistic, the machine learning process involves three steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Feed a machine learning model training input data. In our case, this could be customer comments from social media or customer service data.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Tag training data with a desired output. In this case, tell your sentiment analysis model whether each comment or piece of data is <em>Positive, Neutral,</em> or <em>Negative</em>. The model transforms the training data into <a href=\"https://monkeylearn.com/blog/beginners-guide-text-vectorization/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">text vectors</a> \u2013 numbers that represent data features.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Test your model by feeding it testing (or unseen) data. Algorithms are trained to associate feature vectors with tags based on manually tagged samples, then learn to make predictions when processing unseen data.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If your new model performs to your standards and criteria after testing it, it\u2019s ready to be put to work on all kinds of new data. If it\u2019s not performing accurately, you\u2019ll need to keep training. Furthermore, as human language and industry-specific language morphs and changes, you may need to continually train your model with new information.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-machine-learning-use-cases\">Machine Learning Use Cases</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f439bef1209d3166831f31558e5b8569450de32a/579e8/static/45045437eb6f2392b12d432a90644875/e4918/machine-learning-applications.jpg\" alt=\"Applications\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://monkeylearn.com/blog/machine-learning-applications/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Machine learning applications</a> and use cases are nearly endless, especially as we begin to work from home more (or have <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-15/boe-says-work-after-covid-will-be-done-both-in-home-and-offices\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">hybrid offices</a>), become more tied to our smartphones, and use machine learning-guided technology to get around.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://monkeylearn.com/blog/machine-learning-in-finance/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Machine learning in finance</a>, healthcare, hospitality, government, and beyond, is already in regular use.

By using machine learning, of course.</p>\n<p>There are many different applications of machine learning, which can benefit your business in countless ways. You\u2019ll just need to define a strategy to help you decide the best way to implement machine learning into your existing processes. In the meantime, here are some common machine learning use cases and applications that might spark some ideas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Social Media Monitoring</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Customer Service &amp; Customer Satisfaction</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Image Recognition</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Virtual Assistants</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Product Recommendations</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Stock Market Trading</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Medical Diagnosis</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"heading-social-media-monitoring\">Social Media Monitoring</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://monkeylearn.com/blog/analyzing-customer-support-interactions-on-twitter-with-machine-learning/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Using machine learning you can monitor mentions of your brand on social media</a> and immediately identify if customers require urgent attention. By detecting mentions from angry customers, in real-time, you can <a href=\"https://monkeylearn.com/blog/auto-tagging-customer-feedback-with-machine-learning/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">automatically tag customer feedback</a> and respond right away. You might also want to analyze customer support interactions on social media and gauge <a href=\"https://monkeylearn.com/blog/csat-calculation/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">customer satisfaction (CSAT)</a>, to see how well your team is performing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://monkeylearn.com/blog/nlp-python/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Natural Language Processing</a> gives machines the ability to break down spoken or written language much like a human would, to process \u201cnatural\u201d language, so machine learning can handle text from practically any source.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-customer-service-customer-satisfaction\">Customer Service &amp; Customer Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Machine learning allows you to <a href=\"https://monkeylearn.com/blog/zendesk-machine-learning/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">integrate powerful text analysis tools with customer support tools</a>, so you can analyze your emails, live chats, and all manner of internal data on the go. You can use machine learning to tag support tickets and route them to the correct teams or auto-respond to common queries so you never leave a customer in the cold.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, using machine learning to set up a <a href=\"https://monkeylearn.com/blog/voice-of-customer-program/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">voice of customer (VoC) program</a> and a <a href=\"https://monkeylearn.com/blog/customer-feedback-loop/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">customer feedback loop</a> will ensure that you follow the customer journey from start to finish to improve the customer experience (CX), <a href=\"https://monkeylearn.com/blog/customer-churn-analysis/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">decrease customer churn</a>, and, ultimately, increase your profits.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-image-recognition\">Image Recognition</h3>\n<p>Image recognition is helping companies identify and classify images. For example, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_recognition_system\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">facial recognition</a> technology is being used as a form of identification, from unlocking phones to <a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/facial-recognition-payments-rolled-russia-132117843.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALNtRv5uWrd8hRSE60AldUxuED2Q1gKcmO9_NUdcKLJvuPAX23STUavdKYLR7cKIydB89adb_9Lm9eiU5XjF1h63QPbD35zJKbn8bfd9yhTg3pjlZyubtDD4ivh7vGNhRCleToUEEf69rAiRAYzjKbrklfxy6jWQcs5KyHqQnPVk\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">making payments</a>.</p>\n<p>Self-driving cars also use image recognition to perceive space and obstacles. For example, they can learn to recognize stop signs, identify intersections, and make decisions based on what they see.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-virtual-assistants\">Virtual Assistants</h3>\n<p>Virtual assistants, like Siri, Alexa, Google Now, all make use of machine learning to automatically process and answer voice requests. They quickly scan information, remember related queries, learn from previous interactions, and send commands to other apps, so they can collect information and deliver the most effective answer.</p>\n<p>Customer support teams are already using virtual assistants to handle phone calls, <a href=\"https://monkeylearn.com/blog/automatically-route-customer-support-tickets-to-the-most-appropriate-person/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">automatically route support tickets</a>, to the correct teams, and speed up interactions with customers via computer-generated responses.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-product-recommendations\">Product Recommendations</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_rule_learning\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Association rule-learning</a> is a machine learning technique that can be used to analyze purchasing habits at the supermarket or on e-commerce sites. It works by searching for relationships between variables and finding common associations in transactions (products that consumers usually buy together). This data is then used for product placement strategies and similar product recommendations.</p>\n<p>Associated rules can also be useful to plan a marketing campaign or analyze web usage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-stock-market-trading\">Stock Market Trading</h3>\n<p>Machine learning algorithms can be trained to identify trading opportunities, by recognizing patterns and behaviors in historical data. Humans are often driven by emotions when it comes to making investments, so <a href=\"https://monkeylearn.com/blog/sentiment-analysis-machine-learning/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">sentiment analysis with machine learning</a> can play a huge role in identifying good and bad investing opportunities, with no human bias, whatsoever. They can even save time and <a href=\"https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/20028/how-is-ai-revolutionizing-fx-market-in-a-way-we-didnt-even-realize\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">allow traders more time away from their screens by automating tasks</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-medical-diagnosis\">Medical Diagnosis</h3>\n<p>The ability of machines to find patterns in complex data is shaping the present and future. Take <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/348368\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">machine learning initiatives during the COVID-19 outbreak</a>, for instance. AI tools have helped predict how the virus will spread over time, and shaped how we control it. It\u2019s also helped diagnose patients by analyzing lung CTs and detecting fevers using facial recognition, and identified patients at a higher risk of developing serious respiratory disease.</p>\n<p>Machine learning is driving innovation in many fields, and every day we\u2019re seeing new interesting use cases emerge. In business, the overall benefits of machine learning include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>It\u2019s cost-effective and scalable.</strong> You only need to train a machine learning model once, and you can scale up or down depending on how much data you receive.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Performs more accurately than humans.</strong> Machine learning models are trained with a certain amount of labeled data and will use it to make predictions on unseen data. Based on this data, machines define a set of rules that they apply to all datasets, helping them provide consistent and accurate results. No need to worry about human error or innate bias. And you can train the tools to the needs and criteria of your business.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Works in real-time, 24/7.</strong> Machine learning models can automatically analyze data in real-time, allowing you to immediately detect negative opinions or urgent tickets and take action.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"heading-get-started-with-machine-learning-tools\">Get Started With Machine Learning Tools</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/dbf56c77075ae541268fb144e637253a6e30c8cd/24f84/static/d991f222f3d3be2ac3fbad7277e9a0ad/e4918/tools.jpg\" alt=\"How to Get Started\"></p>\n<p>When you\u2019re ready to get started with machine learning tools it comes down to the <a href=\"https://monkeylearn.com/blog/build-vs-buy/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Build vs. Buy Debate</a>.

The key benefits of SAP HANA migration include:\r\n\r\n- It\u2019s a future-proof solution as you can get quarterly updates for your&#160;SAP S/4HANA cloud systems.\r\n\r\n- The system is easy to use and comes with a simplified user experience, due to which one can make heavy usage of SAP\u2019s new technologies without difficulty.\r\n\r\n- The Business Suite data model of SAP has been largely simplified. For instance, SAP has been able to reduce the memory footprint of users\u2019 databases, which makes the system run faster.\r\n\r\n- Gain accurate business insights in real-time, thus enhancing your decision-making abilities. This has been made possible by the high-performing analytics engine and a simplified data model, which helps to optimize one\u2019s business processes and work with higher agility.\r\n\r\n## **Top 3 Approaches for SAP HANA Migration**\r\n\r\nSo, we have learned that the SAP HANA migration has great potential for business growth. Now what? To answer that, we will make a proper migration plan based on either of the following approaches.\r\n\r\n### **1. The Greenfield Approach**\r\n\r\nThe Greenfield Approach involves a new implementation of the SAP S/4HANA platform, and it needs a complete transformation on the part of the management. However, this approach can be time-consuming and needs some effort since you need to start the entire process from scratch.\r\n\r\nOne positive side of this approach is that you can simplify your core business processes and restructure your operations for enhanced output. What\u2019s more, using the Greenfield Approach, you can enjoy the complete benefits of the S/4HANA ERP platform.\r\n\r\nIf you are willing to take this approach, you need to ensure that you are ready for the entire organization and redefining process. Because for some companies, this can be quite tiresome, especially when they are focusing on short-term goals.\r\n\r\n### **2. The Brownfield Approach**\r\n\r\nWhen the Greenfield Approach seems overwhelming or too tiresome, there\u2019s always a second way out \u2013 that is the Brownfield Approach. In fact, SAP recommends this method for its existing customers to make the migration easier for them.\r\n\r\nIn this way, the current customers operating on the SAP ECC system can easily transform while still working on their existing databases without hassle. It makes the migration smoother, easier, and quicker.\r\n\r\nThe Brownfield process allows you to continue your business operations on your existing systems while slowly adopting the technologies of the new system over time. It helps users to adapt to changes more seamlessly without facing any business discontinuity or disruption.\r\n\r\nAlthough this approach may come with the risks of experiencing more technical issues, the SAP system comes fully equipped with effective solutions to support a seamless flow of your business operations. The best part is, you will get complete guidance and conversion tools to make way for a risk-free migration.\r\n\r\n### **3. Landscape Transformation**\r\n\r\nThe landscape transformation approach doesn\u2019t involve a conversion of the entire system. Instead, it focuses on the transformation of certain portions of the business process only. In other words, you can migrate only the processes you want and continue using the existing systems.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the landscape transformation method allows you to make selective migrations or convert the entire system for a more consolidated workflow by integrating SAP and non-SAP systems under one roof. You can first select a particular process that will offer you the highest revenue in short periods. You can always migrate other business processes later as per your needs.\r\n\r\n## Key Steps\r\n\r\nMigrating to **SAP S/4HANA** is a strategic move for digital transformation. Here&#39;s an overview of the key steps:\r\n\r\n1. **Assess and Plan**: Evaluate your current ERP landscape, define migration objectives, and create a comprehensive plan.\r\n\r\n2. **Landscape Preparation**: Ensure technical prerequisites are met, optimize data, and address custom code adaptations.\r\n\r\n3. **Migration Approach**: Choose between system conversion or greenfield implementation based on complexity and desired outcomes.\r\n\r\n4. **System Conversion**: Upgrade the existing ERP system, migrate data, transform configurations, and ensure compatibility.\r\n\r\n5. **Greenfield Implementation**: Set up a new SAP S/4HANA system, redesigning processes and leveraging the latest functionalities.\r\n\r\n6. **Testing and Validation**: Thoroughly test the migrated system, validate data integrity, and address identified issues.\r\n\r\n7. **Training and Change Management**: Provide comprehensive user training, educate on new features, and implement change management strategies.\r\n\r\n8. **Go-Live and Support**: Execute the final migration, closely monitor system performance, and provide post-migration support.\r\n\r\nEngage experienced consultants and follow best practices to ensure a successful migration, unlocking the benefits of **SAP S/4HANA**.\r\n\r\n## **Key Takeaway**\r\n\r\nReinvent your business with a transformed working environment and get ready for the future with an optimized ERP solution. Embrace digital innovation through technologies like AI, machine learning, big data, IoT, blockchain, and more.\r\n\r\nAccelerate and redefine your organization through three simple steps \u2013 a) adopt this new system, b) optimize your business, and c) make the ultimate transformation. So, are you ready to build a future-proof business?",

Using Terraform, you create configuration files using&#160;[HCL syntax](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/syntax.html). The HCL syntax allows you to specify the cloud provider - such as Azure - and the elements that make up your cloud infrastructure. After you create your configuration files, you create an&#160;*execution plan*&#160;that allows you to preview your infrastructure changes before they&#39;re deployed. Once you verify the changes, you apply the execution plan to deploy the infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThis article shows how to create an Azure resource group using Terraform.\r\n\r\nIn this article, you learn how to:\r\n\r\n- Create an Azure resource group to hold other Azure resources\r\n\r\n- Verify (using Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell) the resource group was created\r\n\r\n- Delete the resource group when finished using it\r\n\r\n# 1. Configure your environment\r\n\r\n- **Azure subscription**: If you don&#39;t have an Azure subscription, create a&#160;[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&amp;utm_source=microsoft.com&amp;utm_medium=docs&amp;utm_campaign=visualstudio)&#160;before you begin.\r\n\r\n- **Configure Terraform:**&#160;If you haven&#39;t already done so, configure Terraform using one of the following options:\r\n\r\n  - [Configure Terraform in Azure Cloud Shell with Bash](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/terraform/get-started-cloud-shell-bash)\r\n\r\n  - [Configure Terraform in Azure Cloud Shell with PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/terraform/get-started-cloud-shell-powershell)\r\n\r\n  - [Configure Terraform in Windows with Bash](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/terraform/get-started-windows-bash)\r\n\r\n  - [Configure Terraform in Windows with PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/terraform/get-started-windows-powershell)\r\n\r\n# 2. Implement the Terraform code\r\n\r\n1. Create a directory in which to test the sample Terraform code and make it the current directory.\r\n\r\n2. Create a file named&#160;`main.tf`&#160;and insert the following code:\r\n\r\n   terraform {\r\n\r\n   required_version = &quot;\\&gt;=0.12&quot;\r\n\r\n   required_providers {\r\n   azurerm = {\r\n   source = &quot;hashicorp/azurerm&quot;\r\n   version = &quot;\\~\\&gt;2.0&quot;\r\n   }\r\n   }\r\n   }\r\n\r\n   provider &quot;azurerm&quot; {\r\n   features {}\r\n   }\r\n\r\n   resource &quot;random_pet&quot; &quot;rg-name&quot; {\r\n   prefix    = var.resource_group_name_prefix\r\n   }\r\n\r\n   resource &quot;azurerm_resource_group&quot; &quot;rg&quot; {\r\n   name      = random_pet.rg-name.id\r\n   location  = var.resource_group_location\r\n   }\r\n\r\n3\\. Create a file named&#160;`variables.tf`&#160;to contain the project variables and insert the following code:\r\n\r\n    variable &quot;resource_group_name_prefix&quot; {\r\n      default       = &quot;rg&quot;\r\n      description   = &quot;Prefix of the resource group name that&#39;s combined with a random ID so name is unique in your Azure subscription.&quot;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    variable &quot;resource_group_location&quot; {\r\n      default = &quot;eastus&quot;\r\n      description   = &quot;Location of the resource group.&quot;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n4\\. Create a file named&#160;`output.tf`&#160;to display the randomly generated resource group name and insert the following code:\r\n\r\n    output &quot;resource_group_name&quot; {\r\n        value = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name\r\n    }\r\n\r\n# 3. Initialize Terraform\r\n\r\nRun&#160;[terraform init](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/init.html)&#160;to initialize the Terraform deployment. This command downloads the Azure modules required to manage your Azure resources.\r\n\r\n    terraform init\r\n\r\n# 4. Create a Terraform execution plan\r\n\r\nRun&#160;[terraform plan](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/plan.html)&#160;to create an execution plan.\r\n\r\n    terraform plan -out main.tfplan\r\n\r\n**Key points:**\r\n\r\n- The&#160;`terraform plan`&#160;command creates an execution plan, but doesn&#39;t execute it. Instead, it determines what actions are necessary to create the configuration specified in your configuration files. This pattern allows you to verify whether the execution plan matches your expectations before making any changes to actual resources.\r\n\r\n- The optional&#160;`-out`&#160;parameter allows you to specify an output file for the plan. Using the&#160;`-out`&#160;parameter ensures that the plan you reviewed is exactly what is applied.\r\n\r\n- To read more about persisting execution plans and security, see the&#160;[security warning section](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/plan.html#security-warning).\r\n\r\n# 5. Apply a Terraform execution plan\r\n\r\nRun&#160;[terraform apply](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/apply.html)&#160;to apply the execution plan to your cloud infrastructure.\r\n\r\n    terraform apply main.tfplan\r\n\r\n**Key points:**\r\n\r\n- The&#160;`terraform apply`&#160;command above assumes you previously ran&#160;`terraform plan -out main.tfplan`.\r\n\r\n- If you specified a different filename for the&#160;`-out`&#160;parameter, use that same filename in the call to&#160;`terraform apply`.\r\n\r\n- If you didn&#39;t use the&#160;`-out`&#160;parameter, simply call&#160;`terraform apply`&#160;without any parameters.\r\n\r\n# 6. Verify the results\r\n\r\nRun&#160;[az group show](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/group#az_group_show)&#160;to display the resource group.\r\n\r\n    az group show --name &lt;resource_group_name&gt;\r\n\r\n**Key points:**\r\n\r\n- The resource group name is displayed in the&#160;`terraform apply`&#160;output.\r\n\r\n# 7. Clean up resources\r\n\r\nWhen you no longer need the resources created via Terraform, do the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. Run&#160;[terraform plan](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/plan.html)&#160;and specify the&#160;`destroy`&#160;flag.\r\n\r\n   terraform plan -destroy -out main.destroy.tfplan\r\n\r\n**Key points:**\r\n\r\n- The&#160;`terraform plan`&#160;command creates an execution plan, but doesn&#39;t execute it. Instead, it determines what actions are necessary to create the configuration specified in your configuration files. This pattern allows you to verify whether the execution plan matches your expectations before making any changes to actual resources.\r\n\r\n- The optional&#160;`-out`&#160;parameter allows you to specify an output file for the plan. Using the&#160;`-out`&#160;parameter ensures that the plan you reviewed is exactly what is applied.\r\n\r\n- To read more about persisting execution plans and security, see the&#160;[security warning section](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/plan.html#security-warning).\r\n\r\n2\\. Run&#160;[terraform apply](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/apply.html)&#160;to apply the execution plan.\r\n\r\n    terraform apply main.destroy.tfplan\r\n\r\n# Troubleshoot Terraform on Azure\r\n\r\n[Troubleshoot common problems when using Terraform on Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/terraform/troubleshoot)\r\n\r\n# Next steps\r\n\r\n**[Learn more about using Terraform in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/terraform)**",

Does your onboarding welcome new employees into the fold, and set them up for longevity?\r\n\r\n# **Components of good onboarding**\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nAt Stack Overflow, we use our own knowledge sharing and collaboration platform, Stack Overflow for Teams, as an integral part of the onboarding process. Our onboarding process comprises four components:The components of good onboarding\r\n\r\n- Content\r\n\r\n- Culture\r\n\r\n- Inter-departmental transparency\r\n\r\n- Future planning\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n# **Content**\r\n\r\nCreating and managing content is how you ensure all of those policies are communicated during onboarding. From password processes and initial security measures to the company mission and the review cycle structure, you\u2019ll be documenting everything.\r\n\r\nAt Stack Overflow, all of our internal knowledge lives on Stack Overflow for Teams. New hires (and not-so-new hires!) are free to revisit it at any time. The information stays current, because people are updating it all the time with the latest knowledge. Whatever you use, you should make sure that your new hires have continuous access to onboarding information. Write articles, how-to guides, checklists, or company hierarchies and contact information. Then make sure that information is visible to all.\r\n\r\nWhat type of content should you develop? Here are some ideas taken directly from our onboarding:\r\n\r\n- Employee handbooks\r\n\r\n- Processes and procedures\r\n\r\n- History of the product(s)\r\n\r\n- History of the organization\r\n\r\n- Tests and results\r\n\r\n- Company updates\r\n\r\n- \u201cFirst 12 weeks at \\[Company\\]\u201d checklist\r\n\r\n**Question - [Virtual Desktop Setup](https://soedemo.stackenterprise.co/questions/17889)**\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n# **Culture**\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a direct relationship between how much an employee understands the corporate culture and how quickly they can integrate into their team. You will need to explain the components of the culture and give pointers right away.\r\n\r\nWhile \u201cculture\u201d can have several definitions, think about the specifics of your organizational culture handles situations like the following:\r\n\r\n- How do people work together - is it mostly autonomous, or heavy on the teamwork and communication?\r\n\r\n- Do you frequently use meetings to hash things out, or do people try to limit meetings to strictly when necessary?\r\n\r\n- How do people in your organization socialize? When and where do people have fun and bond?\r\n\r\n- What extracurricular activities are available?\r\n\r\n- Where should a new hire look for mentorship?\r\n\r\n- How do your company\u2019s mission and values filter down into the day-to-day?\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n# Inter-departmental transparency\r\n\r\nThe best answers to questions can come from anywhere. But the first step, for new hires, is knowing exactly where \u201canywhere\u201d is. Does your organization have one Design department, or are specific product-focused designers placed on different teams? How does content and marketing work? Who is involved in the software engineering lifecycle?\r\n\r\nOrg charts and subject matter experts\u2019 contact information should be widely accessible. As you create your onboarding framework, think about how to surface contacts and useful information from every department, and make it accessible beyond the confines of that specific team.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n# Future planning\r\n\r\nOne of your major goals with onboarding is to show new hires that they can have a long and fulfilling career within your organization. With Stack Overflow for Teams, you can apply the practices of onboarding across all seniority levels and tenures.\r\n\r\nFor example, after someone receives a promotion, or transfers to a new team, or comes back from a sabbatical.\r\n\r\nOnboarding is about personal progression. A new hire\u2019s progression doesn\u2019t need to stop, just because they \u201cage out\u201d of being a new hire. So try to extend your onboarding best practices to all employees in all situations. What does that look like?\r\n\r\n- Mapping key goals and milestone\r\n\r\n- Laying out the best practices for moving from an individual contributor to a manager with direct reports\r\n\r\n- Creating spaces for an employee to develop something new (like Google\u2019s famous 20% projects)\r\n\r\n- Laying out expectations at each rung of the corporate ladder\r\n\r\n- Use cases and success stories around experiments, a new practice, an insight uncovered, or cross-team collaboration\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here](https://soedemo.stackenterprise.co/images/a/0b3e2dfe-82e6-45c1-93fc-00c8ee508062.png)](https://soedemo.stackenterprise.co/images/a/0b3e2dfe-82e6-45c1-93fc-00c8ee508062.png)\r\n\r\nWe put this \u201ccontinuous onboarding\u201d philosophy to work through Stack Overflow for Teams. We\u2019ve created \u201c[Collections](https://soedemo.stackenterprise.co/articles/16555)\u201d for many of our internal teams. Collections are groups of articles, Q&amp;As, how-to guides, and other useful information about a certain topic. These collections are easily searchable and anyone can contribute to them.\r\n\r\nThat way, employees at all stages of their careers feel empowered to harness the collected wisdom of their peers. We have collections around topics like \u201cHow to talk about Stack Overflow\u201d, \u201cCustomer success collateral\u201d, \u201cEnterprise architecture\u201d, \u201cManaging people,\u201d and more.",

Our onboarding process comprises four components:The components of good onboarding</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Content</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Culture</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Inter-departmental transparency</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Future planning</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"heading-content\"><strong>Content</strong></h1>\n<p>Creating and managing content is how you ensure all of those policies are communicated during onboarding. From password processes and initial security measures to the company mission and the review cycle structure, you\u2019ll be documenting everything.</p>\n<p>At Stack Overflow, all of our internal knowledge lives on Stack Overflow for Teams. New hires (and not-so-new hires!) are free to revisit it at any time. The information stays current, because people are updating it all the time with the latest knowledge. Whatever you use, you should make sure that your new hires have continuous access to onboarding information. Write articles, how-to guides, checklists, or company hierarchies and contact information. Then make sure that information is visible to all.</p>\n<p>What type of content should you develop? Here are some ideas taken directly from our onboarding:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Employee handbooks</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Processes and procedures</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>History of the product(s)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>History of the organization</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Tests and results</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Company updates</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>\u201cFirst 12 weeks at [Company]\u201d checklist</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Question - <a href=\"https://soedemo.stackenterprise.co/questions/17889\">Virtual Desktop Setup</a></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"heading-culture\"><strong>Culture</strong></h1>\n<p>There\u2019s a direct relationship between how much an employee understands the corporate culture and how quickly they can integrate into their team. You will need to explain the components of the culture and give pointers right away.</p>\n<p>While \u201cculture\u201d can have several definitions, think about the specifics of your organizational culture handles situations like the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>How do people work together - is it mostly autonomous, or heavy on the teamwork and communication?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Do you frequently use meetings to hash things out, or do people try to limit meetings to strictly when necessary?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>How do people in your organization socialize? When and where do people have fun and bond?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>What extracurricular activities are available?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Where should a new hire look for mentorship?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>How do your company\u2019s mission and values filter down into the day-to-day?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"heading-inter-departmental-transparency\">Inter-departmental transparency</h1>\n<p>The best answers to questions can come from anywhere. But the first step, for new hires, is knowing exactly where \u201canywhere\u201d is. Does your organization have one Design department, or are specific product-focused designers placed on different teams? How does content and marketing work? Who is involved in the software engineering lifecycle?</p>\n<p>Org charts and subject matter experts\u2019 contact information should be widely accessible. As you create your onboarding framework, think about how to surface contacts and useful information from every department, and make it accessible beyond the confines of that specific team.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"heading-future-planning\">Future planning</h1>\n<p>One of your major goals with onboarding is to show new hires that they can have a long and fulfilling career within your organization. With Stack Overflow for Teams, you can apply the practices of onboarding across all seniority levels and tenures.</p>\n<p>For example, after someone receives a promotion, or transfers to a new team, or comes back from a sabbatical.</p>\n<p>Onboarding is about personal progression. A new hire\u2019s progression doesn\u2019t need to stop, just because they \u201cage out\u201d of being a new hire. So try to extend your onboarding best practices to all employees in all situations. What does that look like?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Mapping key goals and milestone</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Laying out the best practices for moving from an individual contributor to a manager with direct reports</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Creating spaces for an employee to develop something new (like Google\u2019s famous 20% projects)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Laying out expectations at each rung of the corporate ladder</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Use cases and success stories around experiments, a new practice, an insight uncovered, or cross-team collaboration</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://soedemo.stackenterprise.co/images/a/0b3e2dfe-82e6-45c1-93fc-00c8ee508062.png\"><img src=\"https://soedemo.stackenterprise.co/images/a/0b3e2dfe-82e6-45c1-93fc-00c8ee508062.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n<p>We put this \u201ccontinuous onboarding\u201d philosophy to work through Stack Overflow for Teams. We\u2019ve created \u201c<a href=\"https://soedemo.stackenterprise.co/articles/16555\">Collections</a>\u201d for many of our internal teams. Collections are groups of articles, Q&amp;As, how-to guides, and other useful information about a certain topic. These collections are easily searchable and anyone can contribute to them.</p>\n<p>That way, employees at all stages of their careers feel empowered to harness the collected wisdom of their peers. We have collections around topics like \u201cHow to talk about Stack Overflow\u201d, \u201cCustomer success collateral\u201d, \u201cEnterprise architecture\u201d, \u201cManaging people,\u201d and more.</p>\n"

The API can record purchase items, calculate totals, confirm payment, track an order&#39;s progress through fulfillment, and update a catalog inventory.\r\n\r\nWith the Orders API, you can build web and mobile applications that use orders to manage purchase item information, track order fulfillment, integrate customer data, and link payments. You can also create fulfillment orders and send them to the Square Point of Sale application for fulfillment.\r\n\r\n### Important\r\n\r\nIf you use the Square Orders API with a non-Square payments provider, Square charges a transaction fee. For more information, see&#160;[Orders API fee structure.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/payments-pricing#orders-api-fee-structure)\r\n\r\n## \r\n\r\n## Orders components\r\n\r\nThe Orders API works with the following key data types:\r\n\r\n- `Order`. The top-level container for order information. Order objects include fields for line item details, fulfillment details, and order summary data, including the location ID credited with the order and the total amount of taxes collected.\r\n\r\n- `OrderLineItem`. Represents a purchase item (for example, a coffee or T-shirt). Each line item has a&#160;`OrderLineItemModifier`&#160;that represents an available size or color. Items and modifiers can be built from Catalog objects or they can be defined ad hoc (at the time of creation).\r\n\r\n- `OrderLineItemDiscount`&#160;and&#160;`OrderLineItemTax`. A price modifier that can be applied at the order or line item level. Taxes and discounts can be configured as Catalog objects and referenced in the order or they can be created ad hoc.\r\n\r\n- `OrderFulfillment`. Contains details about how to fulfill this order, such as the customer name or the time at which the customer should pick up the order. Order objects made with fulfillments are pushed to the Square Seller Dashboard when charged, so sellers can manage order fulfillment in the Square Point of Sale application.\r\n\r\n- `OrderSource`. Tracks the digital or physical source of the order. Orders can be searched or retrieved by the source.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see&#160;[Orders objects and data types.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/orders-api/how-it-works#orders-objects-and-datatypes)\r\n\r\n## \r\n\r\n## Integrating with the Orders API\r\n\r\nThe Orders API integrates seamlessly with other Square APIs and resources to expand the functionality of your application.\r\n\r\n### \r\n\r\n### Square Point of Sale\r\n\r\nOrders with fulfillment that have been fully paid are pushed to the Square Point of Sale application, so that sellers can manage fulfillment with the Square Point of Sale application. The Orders API currently supports two types of fulfillment orders: Pickup and Shipment. For more information, see&#160;[Add fulfillment details.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/orders-api/create-orders#add-fulfillment-details)\r\n\r\n### \r\n\r\n### Payments\r\n\r\nLink your payments to Order objects to itemize sales and apply price modifiers such as taxes, discounts, and service charges. You can also use the Orders API to retrieve any payment activity associated with a sale, whether from the Square Point of Sale application, invoices, or an integration build with the Payments API and Orders API.&#160;For more information, see&#160;[Pay for Orders.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/orders-api/pay-for-orders)\r\n\r\n### \r\n\r\n### Catalog\r\n\r\nLine items, line item modifiers, taxes, and discounts can all be defined as catalog objects. The Orders API reaches its full range of capabilities when orders are built using Square&#160;[catalog objects.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/catalog-api/what-it-does)\r\n\r\nKey advantages to using catalog items include:\r\n\r\n- Orders that reference catalog IDs for taxes and discounts are automatically calculated and applied these price modifiers.\r\n\r\n- Orders that reference catalog line items use details defined in the catalog, such as the item name and price.\r\n\r\n- When these orders are closed, Square updates the inventory for those items.\r\n\r\nTake some time to&#160;[set up your catalog with the Catalog API](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/catalog-api/build-with-catalog)&#160;to unlock the full range of capabilities from the Orders API. For more information, see&#160;[Create Orders.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/orders-api/create-orders)\r\n\r\n### Did you know?\r\n\r\nOrders can also be built from ad hoc line items defined at the time of Order object creation. You need to supply an item name and price.\r\n\r\n### \r\n\r\n### Customers\r\n\r\nOrder objects can reference a customer profile. You can later use&#160;`SearchOrders`&#160;to search orders by customer. For more information about making customer profiles, see&#160;[Keep Records of Customer Profiles.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/customers-api/use-the-api/keep-records)\r\n\r\n### Important\r\n\r\nThe Orders API integration with the Customers API is in beta. For more information about known beta issues, see&#160;[the changelog.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/changelog/connect-logs/2019-08-15)\r\n\r\n### \r\n\r\n### Customer assignments for orders and payments\r\n\r\nIn the Seller Dashboard, transaction activity is based on the&#160;`customer_id`&#160;of the order and other related settings, but the&#160;`customer_id`&#160;of the payment is ignored. For example, if the order does not have a customer assignment, the transaction&#39;s&#160;**Paid by**&#160;field might not display the customer who is assigned to the payment. To reliably link transactions to customers in the Seller Dashboard, make sure to specify the&#160;`customer_id`&#160;field in your&#160;`CreateOrder`&#160;request.\r\n\r\nIn addition, omitting this field on the&#160;`Order`&#160;object might result in the creation of new&#160;[instant profiles](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/customers-api/what-it-does?preview=true#instant-profiles)&#160;that are linked to the payment.\r\n\r\n## Related topics\r\n\r\n- [Create Orders](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/orders-api/create-orders)\r\n\r\n- [Pay for Orders](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/orders-api/pay-for-orders)\r\n\r\n- [Manage Orders](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/orders-api/manage-orders)\r\n\r\n- [Video: Manage orders with the Orders API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sldn3byppJU&amp;t=5s)",

The API can record purchase items, calculate totals, confirm payment, track an order's progress through fulfillment, and update a catalog inventory.</p>\n<p>With the Orders API, you can build web and mobile applications that use orders to manage purchase item information, track order fulfillment, integrate customer data, and link payments. You can also create fulfillment orders and send them to the Square Point of Sale application for fulfillment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-important\">Important</h3>\n<p>If you use the Square Orders API with a non-Square payments provider, Square charges a transaction fee. For more information, see\u00a0<a href=\"https://developer.squareup.com/docs/payments-pricing#orders-api-fee-structure\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Orders API fee structure.</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-section-1\"></h2>\n<h2 id=\"heading-orders-components\">Orders components</h2>\n<p>The Orders API works with the following key data types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><code>Order</code>. The top-level container for order information. Order objects include fields for line item details, fulfillment details, and order summary data, including the location ID credited with the order and the total amount of taxes collected.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><code>OrderLineItem</code>. Represents a purchase item (for example, a coffee or T-shirt). Each line item has a\u00a0<code>OrderLineItemModifier</code>\u00a0that represents an available size or color. Items and modifiers can be built from Catalog objects or they can be defined ad hoc (at the time of creation).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><code>OrderLineItemDiscount</code>\u00a0and\u00a0<code>OrderLineItemTax</code>. A price modifier that can be applied at the order or line item level. Taxes and discounts can be configured as Catalog objects and referenced in the order or they can be created ad hoc.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><code>OrderFulfillment</code>. Contains details about how to fulfill this order, such as the customer name or the time at which the customer should pick up the order. Order objects made with fulfillments are pushed to the Square Seller Dashboard when charged, so sellers can manage order fulfillment in the Square Point of Sale application.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><code>OrderSource</code>. Tracks the digital or physical source of the order. Orders can be searched or retrieved by the source.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information, see\u00a0<a href=\"https://developer.squareup.com/docs/orders-api/how-it-works#orders-objects-and-datatypes\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Orders objects and data types.</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-section-2\"></h2>\n<h2 id=\"heading-integrating-with-the-orders-api\">Integrating with the Orders API</h2>\n<p>The Orders API integrates seamlessly with other Square APIs and resources to expand the functionality of your application.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-section-3\"></h3>\n<h3 id=\"heading-square-point-of-sale\">Square Point of Sale</h3>\n<p>Orders with fulfillment that have been fully paid are pushed to the Square Point of Sale application, so that sellers can manage fulfillment with the Square Point of Sale application.

Your improved Enterprise Dashboard will be your go to tool for viewing all of the most important metrics that can be used to gain insight into a number of areas, or answer questions such as:\r\n\r\n* The overall health and activity of your community\r\n\r\n* Who the top contributors inside your organization are\r\n\r\n* How much time your engineers are saving when looking for answers or technical information\r\n\r\n* How successful are your internal marketing strategies at driving engagement\r\n\r\n## **Preparing for use**\r\n\r\n**Before using the Dashboard for the first time**, your site&#39;s historical data needs to be loaded by going to&#160;*/developer/enterprise/backfill-daily-metrics*&#160;. This process can take up to 30 minutes, depending on how much information it will need to pull in. There&#39;s a good chance site performance could be impacted due to load on the database, so it&#39;s recommended to&#160;**run the backfill route during low-activity hours**, keeping the number of affected users to a minimum. Once the data is loaded the dashboard will be ready to use and performance will be back to normal.\r\n\r\n**If the&#160;[Teams](https://support.stackenterprise.co/support/solutions/articles/22000227004)&#160;feature is enabled on your site**:&#160;\\\r\nAs of the&#160;[2019.3 release](https://support.stackenterprise.co/support/solutions/articles/22000245194), each Team now has its own activity dashboard, available only to Team owners, like the one introduced for the general area in&#160;[2019.2](https://support.stackenterprise.co/support/solutions/articles/22000241709). It looks and feels the same but is now specific to that Team. Similar to the general area, the Site Administrators need to access&#160;*/developer/enterprise/backfill-daily-metrics/all-teams once*, in order to populate the Teams dashboard with the initial dataset.\r\n\r\n## **Key Features**\r\n\r\nYour Enterprise Dashboard provides all historical data from your community across a variety of metrics. You can filter the data by the following time frames:\r\n\r\n* Last Week\r\n\r\n* Last 4 Weeks\r\n\r\n* Last 3 Months\r\n\r\n* Last 6 Months\r\n\r\n* Last 12 Months\r\n\r\n* All Time\r\n\r\n* Custom Range\r\n\r\nThe data on your dashboard&#160;**refreshes daily at Midnight UTC.**&#160;In addition to metrics, you\u2019ll also find trend data plotted in graphs, percent change for every data point, as well as benchmarks for your Interaction Rate and Answer Ratio. If you would like to see the raw data broken down by day, you can export it at any time by downloading it in .csv format.\r\n\r\n## **Site Metrics and Definitions**\r\n\r\nYour Enterprise Dashboard contains a lot of metrics to help you assess the health of your community and better understand how your developers are engaging with one another in your instance. Below is a list of the metrics as well as a brief description of their measured value:\r\n\r\n* **Interaction Rate:**&#160;Average number of answers, votes, and comments, per question on the site.\r\n\r\n* **New Questions:**&#160;Total number of new questions posted in the selected time period, including all questions, whether deleted, closed, duplicated, etc. Excludes edits.\r\n\r\n* **New Answers:**&#160;Total number of new answers posted in the selected time period, excluding edits.\r\n\r\n* **Median time to answer:**&#160;Time from when a question was initially posted to the time the first answer was posted.\r\n\r\n  * *Note: This only looks at answered questions. For further reading on this calculation, please see our article on&#160;[Median Time to Answer](https://support.stackenterprise.co/support/solutions/articles/22000225055-sql-query-median-time-to-answer-over-a-single-time-period-).*\r\n\r\n* **Answer Ratio:**&#160;Total number of questions that have accepted answers, non-accepted answers, and no answers.\r\n\r\n* **Daily Unique Visitors:**&#160;Highest&#160;number of unique daily visitors to your site in the specified time frame\r\n\r\n* **Votes:**&#160;Total number of votes (both upvotes and downvotes).\r\n\r\n* **Searches:**&#160;Total number of searches performed.\r\n\r\n* **Comments:**&#160;Total number of new comments posted in the selected time period, including deleted comments. Excludes edits.\r\n\r\n* **Edits:**&#160;Total number of edits on questions and answers. Excludes comment edits.\r\n\r\n* **Flags:**&#160;Total number of flags raised.\r\n\r\n* **User Participation:**&#160;Highest number of active and passive users in the specified time frame\r\n\r\n  * *Active Users:*&#160;Users who\u2019ve asked or answered a question; commented, reviewed, or voted on a post; or flagged a post.\r\n\r\n  * *Passive Users:*&#160;Users who only visited or searched.\r\n\r\n## **Interpreting your Data**\r\n\r\nBecause every community is different, it\u2019s best to look at the trends within your community as opposed to comparing metrics to others.&#160;**It\u2019s important to note that you will see fluctuations in these as your community grows and matures.&#160;This is perfectly normal!**&#160;It\u2019s only when there are significant changes or consistent trends should you look to take action.\r\n\r\nHere are a few guidelines to help you get started reviewing the health of your community.&#160;*As always, you can contact your Community Development Manager to discuss these in more detail as well as ways to improve.*\r\n\r\nThe first metric you\u2019ll want to look at is your&#160;**Interaction Rate**. By measuring the average number of answers, votes, and comments, per question, you can see how much value your users are getting from the community. A rate above 5 shows that your users are not only engaging with their peers on the platform but also putting in their own time and effort to post content.\r\n\r\nYour&#160;**New Questions**&#160;and&#160;**New Answers**&#160;are two more indicators of engagement and activity within your community. Community size and maturity can have a big impact on these metrics, so it\u2019s more important to look at them over time to ensure neither are dropping too much. It\u2019s also worth looking at these when new groups of users are introduced to the site or after awareness/engagement projects kick off internally. Any spikes in activity can indicate new groups are using Stack Overflow Enterprise and finding value in your community or that your marketing efforts were successful.\r\n\r\nThe&#160;**Median Time to Answer**&#160;is another important metric, as it measures how quickly your users are getting answers to their questions and can be a great indicator for ROI. The shorter the time, the more efficient your users can work and the more money you can save in lost productivity. This should decrease as your community matures and adds in more integrations/webhooks.\r\n\r\nYour&#160;**Answer Ratio**&#160;will be more important as your community matures and should be used to identify potential knowledge gaps and/or engagement issues. If you see a large amount of unanswered questions in general or for a specific tag, this could indicate the need for more experts/users watching those tags or a need to set up more webhooks and/or integrations. You\u2019ll also want to look at your accepted answers rate, which should be above 40% to ensure users can always find the correct/most helpful answers.\r\n\r\nThe&#160;**Daily Unique Visitors**&#160;metric simply tracks the number of users logging in and viewing &#160;the site once per day. An upward trend or positive spikes would indicate more users are making Stack Overflow Enterprise a part of their daily workflow while a significant drop in visits may be attributed to a slower pace of new posts or users gravitating towards other platforms/old habits.\r\n\r\n**Votes, Comments, and Edits**&#160;are also metrics that track engagement, and positive trends in these show that your users are taking ownership of the community and putting in extra time on the site to improve its overall health. Similar to your visits, negative trends here could mean there\u2019s less new content to interact with on the site.\r\n\r\nThe number of&#160;**Searches**&#160;is another great way to measure ROI. More searches on the site show that your users see Stack Overflow Enterprise as the source of truth within your organization. Comparing it to usage across other tools can help you visualize a users workflow as well as potentially identify older tools that are no longer needed.\r\n\r\nYour&#160;**Flags**&#160;metric might change over time, increasing as new users are introduced to the community and then decreasing as they learn how to properly post on the platform. A consistent upward trend in flags should be investigated by your moderators to see if there are repeat offenders or common mistakes that should be addressed with further guidance from your Community Team.\r\n\r\nLastly, the&#160;**User Participation**&#160;metrics can help you identify your top contributors, emerging mentors, and internal experts. You can also look at these when running contests such as Hackathons or Answerathons to choose winners based on participation.",

Now we're adding a new tag &quot;testing&quot; in addition to the &quot;test&quot; tag we already had.  In Version 4 we accidentally added &quot;ab-test&quot; instead of testing.  Version 5 was supposed to fix that, but somehow it keeps adding &quot;ab-test&quot;.  So we're choosing a different tag: &quot;clustering&quot;.</p>\n"

We will provide you the server address so you can add a CNAME record to your domain&#39;s DNS records.\r\n\r\n* SAML 2.0 Configuration Details from your Directory or Identity Services Team\r\n\r\n* (Optional) Details of an SMTP Server, or you may use the Sendgrid SMTP Service that we configure by default.\r\n\r\nOnce we get the brand kit and determine the domain name of your site we do the following:\r\n\r\n* Provision the infrastructure for your site in our Azure Subscription and deploy the application.\r\n\r\n* Coordinate a meeting with your Directory or Identity Services team to configure and validate the SAML 2.0 Configuration\r\n\r\n* Once the first user has logged in, we will hand off to our Customer Success Team for Product Training and Community Building\r\n\r\n# Components\r\n\r\nThe Stack Overflow Enterprise product is comprised of the following components:\r\n\r\n* Application / IIS\r\n\r\n* SQL\r\n\r\n* Redis\r\n\r\n* ElasticSearch\r\n\r\n* Storage\r\n\r\n* Email\r\n\r\nBelow is a brief description of each component.\r\n\r\n## Application / IIS\r\n\r\nThe application is deployed as a site in Internet Information Services (IIS) on the provisioned Windows Server. The application can only serve the site over HTTPS. Users connect to the site via a javascript-enabled browser. The application is configured to talk to a Redis server, an ElasticSearch server, a SQL Server, and an email server.\r\n\r\n## SQL Databases\r\n\r\nThe application requires the creation of two empty databases with db_owner privileges along with the connection strings to these two databases. The databases should be named a variant of SitesEE and StackOverflowEE. The default schema for the user needs to be set to &quot;dbo&quot; for both databases. These two databases store the data for the site, and the logs and exceptions from the application. We currently require SQL Server 2016 SP1+/2017 Standard Edition or Enterprise Edition or Azure SQL Database Services. The SQL Server may reside on a VM in the Cloud. You may also use AWS RDS SQL Server 2016/2017, but we do not officially provide support for it.\r\n\r\n## Redis\r\n\r\nRedis is used by the application to cache values in order to minimize queries and expensive computations performed in the SQL databases. Redis is also used as a publish and subscribe mechanism where one Redis server can publish a message and all other subscribers receive it - including downstream clients on Redis slaves. We currently ship version 2.8.2402 for Windows. For Load Balanced setups, we support running Redis in a master-slave configuration on CentOS 7 servers.\r\n\r\n## Elasticsearch\r\n\r\nElasticsearch is used by the application to index data in order to perform searches on the site, calculate related questions, and provide suggestions when asking a question. Up to version 2.0.3826, we ship Elasticsearch 1.7.1 for Windows. Starting version 2018.1.x, we ship Elasticsearch 5.6 for Windows. For Load Balanced setups, we support running Elasticsearch in a 3-node cluster on a set of CentOS 7 servers.\r\n\r\n## Storage\r\n\r\nThe application supports image uploads for question/answer posts and user profile images. For a single-node setup, you may use a folder on the local web server. We also support Azure Storage Service via the use of an access key. For a load balanced setup, you will need to use a UNC path to a network share, or a locally mounted network drive on each web server.\r\n\r\n## Email\r\n\r\nThe application can send notification and subscription emails if you provide the details of an SMTP Server. The application supports SSL and authentication.\r\n\r\n# Load Balanced and High Availability Setups\r\n\r\n## Azure Hosted\r\n\r\nThe Azure Hosted service is configured by default, in one region, load balanced over two web&#160;servers. You may upgrade to a multi-region HA setup, along with additional web servers for an additional cost.\r\n\r\n## On Premises\r\n\r\nWe do not provide support for a load balanced setup for installs with less than 1000 users. Instead, the application, Redis, and Elasticsearch are installed on a single Windows Server.\r\n\r\nWe provide support for a load balanced (HA) setup for installs with at least 1000 users. This includes:\r\n\r\n* Support for multiple web servers running IIS\r\n\r\n* Support for a 2 or 3-node Elasticsearch cluster running on Windows 2016 or CentOS 7\r\n\r\n* Support for 2 Redis servers running Windows 2016 or CentOS 7 in a master-slave configuration\r\n\r\n* You may use SQL Server Availability Groups, but we do not provide technical support for this feature.",

The application can only serve the site over HTTPS. Users connect to the site via a javascript-enabled browser. The application is configured to talk to a Redis server, an ElasticSearch server, a SQL Server, and an email server.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-sql-databases\">SQL Databases</h2>\n<p>The application requires the creation of two empty databases with db_owner privileges along with the connection strings to these two databases. The databases should be named a variant of SitesEE and StackOverflowEE. The default schema for the user needs to be set to &quot;dbo&quot; for both databases. These two databases store the data for the site, and the logs and exceptions from the application. We currently require SQL Server 2016 SP1+/2017 Standard Edition or Enterprise Edition or Azure SQL Database Services. The SQL Server may reside on a VM in the Cloud. You may also use AWS RDS SQL Server 2016/2017, but we do not officially provide support for it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-redis\">Redis</h2>\n<p>Redis is used by the application to cache values in order to minimize queries and expensive computations performed in the SQL databases. Redis is also used as a publish and subscribe mechanism where one Redis server can publish a message and all other subscribers receive it - including downstream clients on Redis slaves. We currently ship version 2.8.2402 for Windows. For Load Balanced setups, we support running Redis in a master-slave configuration on CentOS 7 servers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-elasticsearch\">Elasticsearch</h2>\n<p>Elasticsearch is used by the application to index data in order to perform searches on the site, calculate related questions, and provide suggestions when asking a question. Up to version 2.0.3826, we ship Elasticsearch 1.7.1 for Windows. Starting version 2018.1.x, we ship Elasticsearch 5.6 for Windows. For Load Balanced setups, we support running Elasticsearch in a 3-node cluster on a set of CentOS 7 servers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-storage\">Storage</h2>\n<p>The application supports image uploads for question/answer posts and user profile images. For a single-node setup, you may use a folder on the local web server. We also support Azure Storage Service via the use of an access key. For a load balanced setup, you will need to use a UNC path to a network share, or a locally mounted network drive on each web server.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-email\">Email</h2>\n<p>The application can send notification and subscription emails if you provide the details of an SMTP Server. The application supports SSL and authentication.</p>\n<h1 id=\"heading-load-balanced-and-high-availability-setups\">Load Balanced and High Availability Setups</h1>\n<h2 id=\"heading-azure-hosted\">Azure Hosted</h2>\n<p>The Azure Hosted service is configured by default, in one region, load balanced over two web\u00a0servers. You may upgrade to a multi-region HA setup, along with additional web servers for an additional cost.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-on-premises-1\">On Premises</h2>\n<p>We do not provide support for a load balanced setup for installs with less than 1000 users. Instead, the application, Redis, and Elasticsearch are installed on a single Windows Server.</p>\n<p>We provide support for a load balanced (HA) setup for installs with at least 1000 users. This includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Support for multiple web servers running IIS</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Support for a 2 or 3-node Elasticsearch cluster running on Windows 2016 or CentOS 7</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Support for 2 Redis servers running Windows 2016 or CentOS 7 in a master-slave configuration</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>You may use SQL Server Availability Groups, but we do not provide technical support for this feature.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n"

Teams are a perfect place to ask questions that don\u2019t have universal answers. In other words, if you have a question that would not make sense outside of your team, or is perhaps sensitive information that should not be visible to your entire Community, Teams is the perfect place.&#160;\r\n\r\n# Strategy: when to use\r\n\r\nBefore creating a team, it&#39;s good practice to think about a goal or project and the people who can help deliver it collaboratively. Try to avoid creating different teams that have the same set of members, since this approach may not provide the desired focus to meet the goal. Once you&#39;ve created your team, let people know where to contribute and to find existing conversations.\r\n\r\nTeams can be dynamic for project-based work as well as ongoing, to reflect the internal structure of your organization.\r\n\r\n**Possible use cases for Teams:**\r\n\r\n* Support: Issue Management\r\n\r\n* HR: Recruiting\r\n\r\n* Product: Strategy\r\n\r\n* Logistics: Operations\r\n\r\n* Events: Conference planning\r\n\r\nRemember, questions and information posted within a team area are only visible to members of that team. Membership to teams is by invite-only by the Team Owner. If you do have a question that makes sense outside of your team, it\u2019s best to ask in the general Community area instead to avoid locking away that knowledge in private silos.&#160;\r\n\r\n# How to use\r\n\r\nThere are two main roles in Teams: a&#160;*Team Owner*, the person who creates the strategy for the team, and&#160;*Team Members*, the people who they invite to join their team.

Within a Team, users can notify colleagues about questions they may be interested in or for which they may be able to provide answers. This feature is available inside a Team and in the general area of your Community.\r\n\r\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/99JpV3pHf-hQkSbKU-Tt7zj9PTvYYEDgdiLsKb4AYxTlp-3uMfFK5HDbuWnzfw1mOqIy0I4ho8ADDa0dvmxlLVlxweZhOqrC0-0yK0Fq5n0BzoaGINYIGB9T6BqTyhQ_nJlcW6qo)\r\n\r\n**Onboarding: Banners, Checklists, and Starter Questions.

Because it depends on classical communication, which can proceed no faster than the speed of light, it cannot be used for faster-than-light transport or communication of classical bits.

If you&#39;d like to use this feature and aren&#39;t yet on 2020.2 or higher, please&#160;[reach out to support](https://support.stackenterprise.co/support/tickets/new)&#160;to get upgraded.&#160;\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nOrganizations often have different groups of users responsible for different parts of their service. When questions arise under that group&#39;s area of expertise, pinging each user individually or picking and choosing who might be the best option can be cumbersome. We&#39;ve introduced user groups as a method to allow you to reach out to entire groups of users with a single name, rather than individually pinging them all. With careful usage and management of user groups, you can ensure all people who need to know about certain inquiries are informed of it, even as your organization grows and changes over time.\r\n\r\nThe general area of Stack Overflow Enterprise is a one namespace for user groups, and each&#160;[private Team](https://support.stackenterprise.co/support/solutions/articles/22000227004)&#160;(if the&#160;[Teams](https://support.stackenterprise.co/support/solutions/articles/22000227004)&#160;feature is enabled on your instance) is also a separate namespace for user groups. Site Admins can manage user groups for the general area by clicking Admin Settings &gt; User Groups (/enterprise/user-groups).&#160;Team Admins (i.e. Team Owners) can manage user groups for a private team by going to their team &gt; Settings &gt; Groups. View a searchable list of all groups by clicking on view user groups at the top of the Users page.\r\n\r\n## Create and populate a new group\r\n\r\n![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/22060912580/original/MIitLDM_V3Oc6yoVrFwHOQeMS5E7It2NKg.png?1596559278)\r\n\r\nThe Manage Groups page will look like the above, though it will initially be empty. To start creating a new group, click the &quot;Add user group&quot; button. You&#39;ll be prompted with providing a Name for the group, and an optional Description. The Description is only visible to Admins in the Manage Groups page and is meant for book-keeping, but the Name is what your whole Team will see and use, so make sure it&#39;s reflective of what collection of people it needs to represent.&#160;\r\n\r\nOnce you&#39;ve created a user group, you&#39;ll be informed that there are no new users, and provided a button to &quot;Add users to this group&quot;. Click the button, and you&#39;ll be provided a search field to add users.\r\n\r\nOnce you&#39;ve added at least one user to your user group, you&#39;ll see them listed like the following image:\r\n\r\n![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/22060912581/original/rR6HBxpxFfR_64jMd9ikJPb5FJuiNrM9wg.png?1596559279)\r\n\r\n## Modify a group\r\n\r\nFrom the Manage Groups page, there&#39;s a few different management actions you can perform.\r\n\r\n* To add or remove users from an existing group, click on the name of the group, or on the listed number of members for the group. This will take you to the page shown earlier above. New users can be added by clicking &quot;Add users&quot; in the top right. Users can be removed from the group by clicking &quot;Remove&quot; on the right of the user&#39;s entry on the table. Use these actions to ensure the membership of each group is kept up to date.\r\n\r\n* To rename a group, or to change its description, click &quot;Edit&quot; on the right side of the table entry for the group. This will bring up a prompt with the group&#39;s current name and description that can be edited.\r\n\r\n* To delete a group, click &quot;Delete&quot; on the far right. Deleting a group will not affect any of the users in the group, but it will make the group no longer usable in the Q&amp;A and remove any existing notification mentions of the group used in questions or answers.&#160;\r\n\r\n## Notify an entire group\r\n\r\nOnce your User Groups are created as suits your needs, you can then use them in regular Q&amp;A as a method to notify all the members of that group in one mention. When filling out a new question, the selection for &quot;Ask team members&quot; will now include any user groups as an option, like shown in the image below:\r\n\r\n![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/22060912579/original/zRkueXzs-hxT9HAvC3yqK52iTGPmAn2dhg.png?1596559278)\r\n\r\nUser Groups can also be referred to in comments or posts using @ in the same way you would notify any individual member of your Team.\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please&#160;[reach out to support](https://support.stackenterprise.co/support/tickets/new)&#160;for further guidance.",

If you'd like to use this feature and aren't yet on 2020.2 or higher, please\u00a0<a href=\"https://support.stackenterprise.co/support/tickets/new\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">reach out to support</a>\u00a0to get upgraded.\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Organizations often have different groups of users responsible for different parts of their service. When questions arise under that group's area of expertise, pinging each user individually or picking and choosing who might be the best option can be cumbersome. We've introduced user groups as a method to allow you to reach out to entire groups of users with a single name, rather than individually pinging them all. With careful usage and management of user groups, you can ensure all people who need to know about certain inquiries are informed of it, even as your organization grows and changes over time.</p>\n<p>The general area of Stack Overflow Enterprise is a one namespace for user groups, and each\u00a0<a href=\"https://support.stackenterprise.co/support/solutions/articles/22000227004\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">private Team</a>\u00a0(if the\u00a0<a href=\"https://support.stackenterprise.co/support/solutions/articles/22000227004\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Teams</a>\u00a0feature is enabled on your instance) is also a separate namespace for user groups. Site Admins can manage user groups for the general area by clicking Admin Settings &gt; User Groups (/enterprise/user-groups).\u00a0Team Admins (i.e. Team Owners) can manage user groups for a private team by going to their team &gt; Settings &gt; Groups. View a searchable list of all groups by clicking on view user groups at the top of the Users page.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-create-and-populate-a-new-group\">Create and populate a new group</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/22060912580/original/MIitLDM_V3Oc6yoVrFwHOQeMS5E7It2NKg.png?1596559278\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The Manage Groups page will look like the above, though it will initially be empty. To start creating a new group, click the &quot;Add user group&quot; button. You'll be prompted with providing a Name for the group, and an optional Description. The Description is only visible to Admins in the Manage Groups page and is meant for book-keeping, but the Name is what your whole Team will see and use, so make sure it's reflective of what collection of people it needs to represent.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once you've created a user group, you'll be informed that there are no new users, and provided a button to &quot;Add users to this group&quot;. Click the button, and you'll be provided a search field to add users.</p>\n<p>Once you've added at least one user to your user group, you'll see them listed like the following image:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/22060912581/original/rR6HBxpxFfR_64jMd9ikJPb5FJuiNrM9wg.png?1596559279\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-modify-a-group\">Modify a group</h2>\n<p>From the Manage Groups page, there's a few different management actions you can perform.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>To add or remove users from an existing group, click on the name of the group, or on the listed number of members for the group. This will take you to the page shown earlier above. New users can be added by clicking &quot;Add users&quot; in the top right. Users can be removed from the group by clicking &quot;Remove&quot; on the right of the user's entry on the table. Use these actions to ensure the membership of each group is kept up to date.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>To rename a group, or to change its description, click &quot;Edit&quot; on the right side of the table entry for the group. This will bring up a prompt with the group's current name and description that can be edited.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>To delete a group, click &quot;Delete&quot; on the far right. Deleting a group will not affect any of the users in the group, but it will make the group no longer usable in the Q&amp;A and remove any existing notification mentions of the group used in questions or answers.\u00a0</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"heading-notify-an-entire-group\">Notify an entire group</h2>\n<p>Once your User Groups are created as suits your needs, you can then use them in regular Q&amp;A as a method to notify all the members of that group in one mention. When filling out a new question, the selection for &quot;Ask team members&quot; will now include any user groups as an option, like shown in the image below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/22060912579/original/zRkueXzs-hxT9HAvC3yqK52iTGPmAn2dhg.png?1596559278\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>User Groups can also be referred to in comments or posts using @ in the same way you would notify any individual member of your Team.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-questions\">Questions</h2>\n<p>If you have any questions, please\u00a0<a href=\"https://support.stackenterprise.co/support/tickets/new\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">reach out to support</a>\u00a0for further guidance.</p>\n"

Dashboards and Looks, which are stored in&#160;, can be pinned to multiple boards. Boards provide a way for users to:\r\n\r\nUsers will only see boards that they have&#160;access to view. A user must have the&#160;**View**&#160;access level to see a board. Users with the&#160;**Manage Access, Edit**&#160;access level can pin dashboards and Looks to the board and provide context for that content to help guide other users.\r\n\r\nAccess to boards and the content that is pinned to them, like Looks or dashboards, depends on a user or group\u2019s&#160;board access, their&#160;[access to the folder in which that content is stored](https://docs.looker.com/sharing-and-publishing/organizing-spaces#viewing_and_managing_access_for_a_space), and the&#160;[model the Look or dashboard is based on](https://docs.looker.com/admin-options/settings/roles#model_sets).\r\n\r\nIf a user doesn\u2019t have folder access for viewing a dashboard or Look, that dashboard or Look will not be displayed to that user on the board. If the user has folder access but not model access, they will see a thumbnail but will not be able to view the underlying Look or dashboard.\r\n\r\n## Board Access Levels\r\n\r\nThere are two access levels that can be assigned to a&#160;[user](https://docs.looker.com/admin-options/settings/users)&#160;or&#160;[group](https://docs.looker.com/admin-options/settings/groups)&#160;for a board:&#160;**View**&#160;and&#160;**Manage Access, Edit**.\r\n\r\nWith the&#160;**View**&#160;access level, a user can see that the board exists,&#160;add the board to their list, and view any pinned content that they have&#160;[access to view](https://docs.looker.com/sharing-and-publishing/organizing-spaces#viewing_and_managing_access_for_a_folder).\r\n\r\nWith the&#160;**Manage Access, Edit**&#160;access level, a user can do everything that the&#160;**View**&#160;access level allows, plus make the following changes to the board:\r\n\r\n* Manage access to the board\r\n\r\n* Organize and manage content on the board\r\n\r\n* Pin and remove Looks and dashboards\r\n\r\n* Delete the board\r\n\r\n## Viewing the Access Levels for a Board\r\n\r\nTo view the access levels that other users and groups have for a board, you must have the&#160;**Manage Access, Edit**&#160;access level for that board. To see who can access a board:\r\n\r\n1. Navigate to the board. In the upper right of the board, to the right of the board\u2019s title and to the left of the three-dot menu and information icon, select the share icon.\r\n\r\n   ![](https://docs.looker.com/assets/images/presenting-content-share-menu-618.png)\r\n\r\n2. Looker displays the&#160;**Manage access**&#160;window for the board.\r\n\r\n3. In the&#160;**Who can access this board?**&#160;section of the window, you can see a list of users and groups who have access to the board as well as their access levels.\r\n\r\n   ![](https://docs.looker.com/assets/images/presenting-content-manage-access-624.png)\r\n\r\n## Managing the Access Levels for a Board\r\n\r\nTo manage access to a board, you need the&#160;**Manage Access, Edit**&#160;access level for that board. To make changes to the access level a group or user has for a board:\r\n\r\n1. Navigate to the board and&#160;view its access levels&#160;by selecting the share icon.\r\n\r\n2. To change the access level for a user or group that is already listed, select their current access level and choose the desired access level from the menu. You cannot change the ability of Looker admins to manage the board.\r\n\r\n   ![](https://docs.looker.com/assets/images/presenting-content-manage-access-existing-624.png)\r\n\r\n3. Remove user or group access by clicking the&#160;**X**&#160;beside the name.\r\n\r\n4. Add one or more groups or users by selecting the&#160;**Add group or user**&#160;field, choosing a group or user, then selecting the desired access level.\r\n\r\n   ![](https://docs.looker.com/assets/images/presenting-content-add-group-user-620.png)\r\n\r\n5. Save your changes by selecting&#160;**Save**.\r\n\r\n# Creating a Board\r\n\r\nBy default, when a board is created, admins and the creator have the&#160;**Manage Access, Edit**&#160;access level, and all other users can interact with the board at the&#160;**View**&#160;access level.\r\n\r\nTo create a new board:\r\n\r\n1. Select the plus icon in the&#160;**Browse**&#160;menu or in the left sidebar in&#160;**Browse**.\r\n\r\n   ![](https://docs.looker.com/assets/images/presenting-content-create-board-plus-icon-620.png)\r\n\r\n2. In the&#160;**Create board**&#160;window, enter a name for your board.\r\n\r\n   ![](https://docs.looker.com/assets/images/presenting-content-create-board-window-620.png)\r\n\r\n3. Select&#160;**Create board**. Looker then adds the new board to your list to the&#160;**Boards**&#160;section of the Browse menu and left sidebar navigation.\r\n\r\n   ![](https://docs.looker.com/assets/images/presenting-content-new-board-in-nav-620.png)\r\n\r\n   As the creator of the board, you will also be listed as a contributor in the&#160;**Contributors**&#160;section of the&#160;**About this board**&#160;information panel:\r\n\r\n   ![](https://docs.looker.com/assets/images/presenting-content-create-board-contributor-620.png)\r\n\r\nYou can then&#160;manage the content on the board&#160;such as&#160;adding sections,&#160;pinning Looks and dashboards,&#160;creating an information section, or&#160;managing access to the board.\r\n\r\n# Adding a Board to Your List\r\n\r\nYou can create a shortcut to a board created by another user by adding that user\u2019s board to a personal list of boards in your Browse menu, similar to a Favorites section. When you add a board to your list, the board will be listed under&#160;**Boards**&#160;in the Browse menu and the left navigation when you browse content in Looker. To add a board to your list, select&#160;**Add to my list**&#160;beneath the title of the board:\r\n\r\n![](https://docs.looker.com/assets/images/presenting-content-add-to-list-620.png)\r\n\r\nTo remove a board from your list, select the board\u2019s three-dot menu and choose&#160;**Remove from my list**:\r\n\r\n![](https://docs.looker.com/assets/images/presenting-content-remove-from-list-620.png)\r\n\r\nThe number of users who have added a board to their list is reflected in the&#160;**About this board**&#160;section of the board\u2019s&#160;information section:\r\n\r\n![](https://docs.looker.com/assets/images/presenting-content-added-to-list-620.png)\r\n\r\n# Arranging Content on a Board\r\n\r\nTo arrange the content on a board, you must have the&#160;**Manage Access, Edit**access level. In addition to&#160;pinning Looks and dashboards&#160;to a board, contributors to a board can arrange the content on a board in the following ways:\r\n\r\n* Add sections\r\n\r\n* Reorder sections\r\n\r\n* Remove sections\r\n\r\n* Move content within sections\r\n\r\n* Drag and drop pinned content between sections\r\n\r\nIf you make changes to a board, you will be listed as a contributor in the&#160;**Contributors**&#160;section of the&#160;**About this board**&#160;information panel:\r\n\r\n![](https://docs.looker.com/assets/images/presenting-content-board-contributors-620.png)\r\n\r\n## Adding Sections to a Board\r\n\r\nWhen you create a board, there is a default section named&#160;**Untitled section**. To edit the name of the section, choose the pencil icon to the right of the name of the board. You can then give the section a new name.\r\n\r\n![](https://docs.looker.com/assets/images/presenting-content-untitled-section-board-620.png)\r\n\r\nTo add a new section to a board, select&#160;**New section**&#160;at the bottom of your board. When you have entered a name for your new section, you can press Enter or return to save the name.\r\n\r\n![](https://docs.looker.com/assets/images/presenting-content-boards-new-section-620.png)\r\n\r\nYou can then begin to&#160;pin Looks and dashboards&#160;to the new section.\r\n\r\n## Reordering Sections on a Board\r\n\r\nTo change the order of the sections on a board:\r\n\r\n1. Hover over the section you want to move and select the vertical six-dot icon to the left of the section title.\r\n\r\n   ![](https://docs.looker.com/assets/images/presenting-content-six-dot-icon-620.png)\r\n\r\n2. Holding the vertical six-dot icon, drag the section to position it above or below another section.\r\n\r\n## Removing Sections from a Board\r\n\r\nIf you have the&#160;**Manage Access, Edit**&#160;access level for a board, you can also delete its sections. To remove a section from a board:\r\n\r\n1. Select the trash icon for the section you want to delete:\r\n\r\n   ![](https://docs.looker.com/assets/images/presenting-content-trash-icon-620.png)\r\n\r\n2. Looker then displays a window to confirm that you want to delete the section.\r\n\r\n   ![](https://docs.looker.com/assets/images/presenting-content-delete-section-window-620.png)\r\n\r\n&gt; *warning*\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; Removing a section from a board also removes any Looks or dashboards that have been&#160;pinned to the board&#160;in that section. However, the Looks and dashboards still exist in their&#160;[folders](https://docs.looker.com/sharing-and-publishing/organizing-spaces).\r\n\r\n## Moving Content Within Sections on a Board\r\n\r\nTo change the order of pinned Looks and dashboards within a section of a board:\r\n\r\n1. Click on the Look or dashboard that you want to move.\r\n\r\n2. Holding the pinned Look or dashboard, drag and drop it within the section of the board that it was pinned to.\r\n\r\n## Moving Content Between the Sections of a Board\r\n\r\nYou can move a&#160;pinned Look or dashboard&#160;from one section to another by dragging and dropping the content you want to move. To move a pinned Look or dashboard from one section to another:\r\n\r\n1. Select the pinned Look or dashboard that you want to move.\r\n\r\n   ![](https://docs.looker.com/assets/images/presenting-content-drag-drop-select-76.png)\r\n\r\n2. Holding the pinned Look or dashboard, drag it until it is positioned within the desired section of the board. If you hover over the new section while holding the Look or dashboard you are moving, Looker displays a message informing you that the Look or dashboard will be placed at the end of the section.\r\n\r\n   ![](https://docs.looker.com/assets/images/presenting-content-drag-to-new-section-76.png)\r\n\r\n3. Drop the Look or dashboard into the desired section. The Look or dashboard will be added to the end of that section.\r\n\r\n   ![](https://docs.looker.com/assets/images/presenting-content-end-of-section-76.png)\r\n\r\n# Adding Descriptions to a Board\r\n\r\nFor boards that you have created or for which you have&#160;**Manage Access, Edit**access, you can&#160;add a description&#160;that will appear in the board\u2019s information panel and in the window that Looker displays when you&#160;[view all boards](https://docs.looker.com/sharing-and-publishing/finding-content#viewing_all_boards). You can also&#160;add a description to each section of a board.\r\n\r\n## Adding a Description for the Entire Board\r\n\r\nIn the&#160;**About this board**&#160;information panel of a board, you can add a text description that will appear in the&#160;**Description**&#160;section. This description can be seen by anyone who can view the board and is a great way to give people context around the data pinned to the board. Your description can be up to 250 characters long and can include URLs and Markdown links.\r\n\r\nTo add or edit a board\u2019s description:\r\n\r\n1. Select the information icon (the letter&#160;**i**&#160;within a circle) to open the board\u2019s informational panel.\r\n\r\n   ![](https://docs.looker.com/assets/images/presenting-content-information-icon-620.png)\r\n\r\n2. Under&#160;**Description**, select the&#160;**Add a description**&#160;text to add a new description.\r\n\r\n   ![](https://docs.looker.com/assets/images/presenting-content-add-description-620.png)\r\n\r\n3. To edit an existing description, hover over the description and select the pencil icon.\r\n\r\n   ![](https://docs.looker.com/assets/images/presenting-content-description-pencil-620.png)\r\n\r\n4. Add a description and select&#160;**Done**&#160;to save the description.\r\n\r\n   ![](https://docs.looker.com/assets/images/presenting-content-new-description-620.png)\r\n\r\n## Adding Descriptions to the Sections of a Board\r\n\r\nYou can add or edit descriptions for each of the sections of a board that you have created or for which you have&#160;**Manage Access, Edit**&#160;access. To add or edit a description to one of a board\u2019s sections:\r\n\r\n1. Select the&#160;**Add description**&#160;text beneath the section title.\r\n\r\n   ![](https://docs.looker.com/assets/images/presenting-content-add-section-description-70.png)\r\n\r\n2. Type in a description of up to 1,300 characters for the section and press the Return key to save the description.\r\n\r\n   ![](https://docs.looker.com/assets/images/presenting-content-enter-section-description-70.png)\r\n\r\n3. The description you have added will display beneath the title of the section.\r\n\r\n   ![](https://docs.looker.com/assets/images/presenting-content-saved-section-description-70.png)\r\n\r\nUsers with&#160;**Manage Access, Edit**&#160;access to a board can modify an existing section description by selecting the existing text and performing the steps outlined above.\r\n\r\n# Pinning Content to a Board\r\n\r\nYou can pin&#160;Looks and user-defined dashboards&#160;that are stored within existing folders, as well as&#160;LookML dashboards, to a board that you&#160;created&#160;or have&#160;access to edit. You can also&#160;unpin content from a board&#160;once it has been pinned.\r\n\r\nOther users will be able to see and interact with pinned content if they have&#160;[access to it](https://docs.looker.com/sharing-and-publishing/organizing-spaces#viewing_and_managing_access_for_a_folder). Because content is stored in folders rather than on boards, adding and removing content from boards does not actually affect the underlying content.\r\n\r\nIf you pin content to a board, you will be listed as a contributor in the&#160;**Contributors**&#160;section of the&#160;**About this board**&#160;information panel:\r\n\r\n![](https://docs.looker.com/assets/images/presenting-content-board-contributors-620.png)\r\n\r\n## Pinning Looks and User-Defined Dashboards to a Board\r\n\r\nThere are three ways to pin Looks and&#160;[user-defined dashboards](https://docs.looker.com/dashboards/creating-user-dashboards)&#160;to a board:\r\n\r\n* Pinning from the board\r\n\r\n* Pinning from a Look or dashboard\u2019s thumbnail in a folder\r\n\r\n* Pinning from the Look or dashboard\u2019s gear menu\r\n\r\n### Pinning from a Board\r\n\r\nTo pin a Look or dashboard to a board while you are viewing or editing the board:\r\n\r\n1. If the section already has pinned content, hover over the section and select the&#160;**+**&#160;icon.\r\n\r\n   ![](https://docs.looker.com/assets/images/presenting-content-plus-icon-pin-620.png)\r\n\r\n   If the section doesn\u2019t have any pinned content, select the&#160;**Pin a Dashboard or Look**&#160;text.\r\n\r\n   ![](https://docs.looker.com/assets/images/presenting-content-pin-to-empty-620.png)\r\n\r\n2. In the&#160;**Pin a Look or Dashboard**&#160;window, select the Look or dashboard that you want to pin to the board. The Look or dashboard you have selected will then appear in the section you have chosen.\r\n\r\n   ![](https://docs.looker.com/assets/images/presenting-content-pin-look-dashboard-window-620.png)\r\n\r\n### Pinning from a Folder\r\n\r\nTo pin a Look or dashboard to a board from a&#160;[folder](https://docs.looker.com/sharing-and-publishing/organizing-spaces)&#160;or from the Look or dashboard itself:\r\n\r\n1. In a folder, select the three-dot menu on the thumbnail for the dashboard or Look you want to pin to a board and choose&#160;**Pin to a board**.\r\n\r\n   ![](https://docs.looker.com/assets/images/presenting-content-pin-from-folder-620.png)\r\n\r\n2. Choose an existing board and section from the&#160;**Select a board**&#160;and&#160;**Select a section in the board**&#160;drop-down menus and select&#160;**Pin**.\r\n\r\n   ![](https://docs.looker.com/assets/images/pin-to-board-from-folder-620.png)\r\n\r\n### Pinning from a Look or Dashboard\r\n\r\nTo pin a Look or dashboard that you are viewing to a board:\r\n\r\n1. Select the gear menu to the right of the&#160;**Run**&#160;and&#160;**Edit**&#160;buttons and choose&#160;**Pin to a board**.\r\n\r\n   ![](https://docs.looker.com/assets/images/pin-from-look-or-dashboard-620.png)\r\n\r\n2.

From within the LookML dashboard, click the gear icon in the top right, and select&#160;**Pin to a board**. Select the board and section to which you would like to pin your LookML dashboard and then click&#160;**Pin**.\r\n\r\n   ![](https://docs.looker.com/assets/images/presenting-content-pin-lookml-620.png)\r\n\r\n## Unpinning Looks and Dashboards from a Board\r\n\r\nTo remove a pinned Look or dashboard from a board:\r\n\r\n![](https://docs.looker.com/assets/images/presenting-content-unpin-from-board-620.png)\r\n\r\n1. Select the three-dot menu on the Look or dashboard.\r\n\r\n2. Choose&#160;**Unpin from this board**.\r\n\r\n&gt; *warning*\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; If you&#160;remove a section from a board, any pinned Looks and dashboards in that section will also be removed.\r\n\r\n# Sharing a Board\r\n\r\nYou can share boards for which you have the&#160;**Manage Access, Edit**&#160;access level by&#160;sharing a link to the board&#160;or by&#160;sending an email notification. Users must have at least the&#160;**View**&#160;access level&#160;for a board in order to view it.\r\n\r\n## Sharing a Link to a Board\r\n\r\nTo obtain a link to a board that you can share with others:\r\n\r\n1.

If you add a user group to a board, however, email notifications will not be sent to the members of the group unless you also add the group members as individual users. To send an email notification:&#160;\r\n\r\n![](https://docs.looker.com/assets/images/presenting-content-notification-checkbox-624.png)\r\n\r\n1. In the&#160;**Manage access**&#160;window for the board,&#160;grant access to the user.\r\n\r\n2. Select the&#160;**Email the people you have just added**&#160;checkbox.\r\n\r\n3. Select&#160;**Save**.\r\n\r\nIndividual users you have added to the board will receive an email notifying them that they have been granted&#160;**View**&#160;or&#160;**Manage Access, Edit**&#160;access to the board. The email also invites users to view the board and encourages them to&#160;add it to their lists.\r\n\r\n![](https://docs.looker.com/assets/images/presenting-boards-notification-624.png)\r\n\r\n# Deleting a Board\r\n\r\n&gt; *warning*\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; When you delete a board, you will not be able to recover it.\r\n\r\nTo delete a board, you must have the&#160;**Manage Access, Edit**&#160;access level.
