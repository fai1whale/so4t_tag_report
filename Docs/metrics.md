# Metrics in the CSV Report
Here is a list of current metrics that are included in the CSV report, as well as what they mean and how they might be used:


| Metric     | Description                                                                          |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Total Page Views | The aggregate number of pageviews across all questions and articles for a given tag. this can be a helpful measurement of how popular the tag is, as well as how often knowledge is being reused within a given tag.|
| Tag Watchers | The number of users who have subscribed to email notifications for a given tag. This can be a gauge of how much visibility this tag receives when a new questions, answer, or article is posted.|
| Communities | The number of communities associated with a given tag. This can be a gauge of how much visibility this tag receives when a new questions, answer, or article is posted.|
| Webhooks | The number of webhooks configured for a given tag (i.e. subscriptions to tag notifications via Slack or Microsoft Teams). This can be a gauge of how much visibility this tag receives when a new questions, answer, or article is posted.| 
| Total SMEs | The number of unique users who have been configured as a Subject Matter Expert (SME) for a given tag. Configuring SMEs makes it easier for users to route questions to the right people. It also provides a baseline level of ownership/acountability for a given tag.|
| Median Time to First Answer | The median amount of time it takes for a question to receive its first answer (in hours). This can be a gauge of how quickly questions are being answered within a given tag.|
| Median Time to First Response | The median amount of time it takes for a question to receive its first response (in hours). In some cases, comments are used to get additional details from the question asker (before an answer can be provided). Additionally, sometimes answers are provided via comments, but not converted to answer. As a rseult, Median Time to First Response, takes the lesser response time between first comment and first answer. In situations where the fast response (answer or comment) is provided by question asker, this metric is not tracked; otherwise, it would skew the numbers in an innaccurate direction. |
| Total Unique Contributors | The number of unique users who have contributed to a given tag (i.e. asked a question, provided an answer, posted a comment, or authored an article). This help measure the overall engagement within a given tag.|
| Unique Askers | The number of unique users who have asked a question within a given tag. |
| Unique Answerers | The number of unique users who have provided an answer within a given tag. |
| Unique Commenters | The number of unique users who have posted a comment within a given tag. |
| Unique Article Contributors | The number of unique users who have authored an article within a given tag. |
| Question Count | The number of questions that have been asked within a given tag. |
| Question Upvotes | The number of upvotes that have been received on questions within a given tag. This can be a measure of how welcoming a tag is as well as how engaged the community is. |
| Question Downvotes | The number of downvotes that have been received on questions within a given tag. this can be a barometer for "bad" questions being asked within a tag or how unwelcoming a tag might be to users. |
| Question Comments | The number of comments that have been posted on questions within a given tag. This can be a measure of how engaged the community is within a given tag. |
| Questions No Answers | The number of questions that have been asked within a given tag that have not received an answer. There's oftentimes going to be some amount of questions where there might not be an answer, an answer hasn't been provided yet, or where the question is answered via comments. However, when the number of unanswered questions is high in proportion to the total number of questions for a tag, it can be an indication that there's a lack of proper ownership or accountability for a given tag. In that case, review/improve your corresponding tag metrics for visibility and ownership, such as Tag Watchers, Communities, Webhooks, and/or Total SMEs |
| Questions Accepted Answer | The number of questions that have been asked within a given tag that have received an accepted answer. This is a measure of how good question askers are at accepting the answer that best helped them. Accepting answers can be important for helping future users (who find the same question) to know which answer (if any) solved the problem. In organizations who use Stack Overflow for Teams heavily for internal support, this metric can be important for providing closure to teams who support/own the tag. |
| Questions Self Answered | The number of questions that have been asked within a given tag that have been answered by the question asker. Generally, this is an informational metric. However, if the number of self-answered questions is high in proportion to the total number of questions for a tag, it can indicate that content isn't being generated organically/naturally (i.e. through community-based interactions) |
| Answer Count | The number of answers that have been provided within a given tag. In contrast to Questions No Answers, if the answer count is high in proportion to the total number of questions for a tag, it can indicate a high level of engagement within a tag, where multiple viewpoints and/or solutions are being provided. |
| SME Answers | The number of answers that have been provided within a given tag by a Subject Matter Expert (SME). This can be a measure of how much ownership/accountability is being provided by SMEs within a given tag. It can be used inversely to measure how much ownership/accountability is being provided by non-SMEs within a given tag (i.e. community-based support rather than relying too heavily on SMEs). |
| Answer Upvotes | The number of upvotes that have been received on answers within a given tag. Upvotes on answers can be even more important than Question Upvotes. First, upvotes on answers (or a lack thereof) can influence how much a subsequent user trusts the answer that has been provided. Second, answerers (often SMEs or more experienced staff members) deserve recognition for the time they invest in providing solutions. Upvoting answers helps those staff members feel like their contributions matter and are valued. |
| Answer Downvotes | The number of downvotes that have been received on answers within a given tag. Unlike StackOverflow.com, downvotes aren't as common since users are not anonymous and they're less likely to downvote a colleague. Instead, commenting an answer to let the colleague know where they went wrong is more common. If there are a high number of downvotes on answers within a given tag, it can indicate that there's a lot of misinformation (bad answers) being spread or that the community for a given tag is a bit unwelcoming to users. |
| Answer Comments | The number of comments that have been posted on answers within a given tag. This can be a measure of how engaged the community is within a given tag. Comments on answers are a great way to improve and update answers, by sharing updates, additional insights, asking follow up questions, etc. |
| Article Count | The number of articles that have been authored within a given tag. |
| Article Upvotes | The number of upvotes that have been received on articles within a given tag. Upvotes on articles can be even more important than Question Upvotes. First, upvotes on articles (or a lack thereof) can influence how much a subsequent user trusts the article that has been provided. Second, article authors (often SMEs or more experienced staff members) deserve recognition for the time they invest in providing solutions. Upvoting articles helps those staff members feel like their contributions matter and are valued. It's worth noting that Articles cannot be downvoted, only upvoted; so, there's Article Downvotes metric. |
| Article Comments | The number of comments that have been posted on articles within a given tag. This can be a measure of how engaged the community is within a given tag. Comments on articles are a great way to improve and update articles, by sharing updates, additional insights, asking follow up questions, etc. |
